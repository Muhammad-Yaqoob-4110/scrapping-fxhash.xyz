The solution we came up with was to transfer the background to the setup and distribute the elements on the screen in such a way that they leave their traces on the background as they move. This way, we no longer need to complicate the rendering process with loops (for).The second challenge we faced was that the code only provided us with a static view of the scene. So, how could different variations be created in the project? To solve this issue, we focused on creating variations based on the distribution of colors.

Biomes,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/biomes,working,"In the far reaches of the cosmos, where the boundaries between reality and dreams blur into an indistinguishable haze, there exists a planet of breathtaking beauty and terrifying complexity. It is a sentient biome, whose very existence defies the laws of nature as we understand them.Here, the skies blaze with colors that shift and change as if they were living entities themselves, reflecting the chaotic yet harmonious energy of the planet below. Jagged and fierce mountains stand like guardians of ancient secrets, their peaks aflame with molten rivers that dance in shades of orange and gold, casting long shadows that seem to pulse with life.In the valleys, forests of crystal trees stretch towards the heavens, their branches etched with patterns that shift like serpents in the depths of a dream. Their colors span a spectrum of green and yellow, glowing softly as if each tree harbors a soul. They whisper to each other in the wind, their secrets carried across the landscape like a melody forgotten and remembered in the same breath.Creatures of light and shadow inhabit this world, their forms as fluid and ever-changing as the landscape itself. Some soar above on wings of pure energy, leaving trails of color that shimmer and dissolve into the air. Others burrow deep into the earth, their bodies glowing with the heat of the planet's core, their movements creating ripples that send shockwaves across the surface.Yet amidst this kaleidoscope of chaos, there exists a strange and beautiful order. The biomes are interconnected, each one feeding into the next in a delicate balance of life and death, growth and decay.In this world, the story of life is told not through words, but through the shifting patterns of the landscape, through the vibrant colors that flicker and pulse with the heartbeat of the planet. It is a tale of resilience, of adaptation, of life finding a way even in the most inhospitable of places.As the stars twinkle in the dark expanse above, casting their cold light on this living, breathing world, the biomes continue to whisper their ancient tales to anyone who will listen. They tell of a planet where life is not merely sustained, but celebrated in a continuous cycle of creation and destruction — a reminder that in the vastness of the universe, life is a force that will always find a way.—-Press [s] for .jpeg | Press [p] for .pngMade with p5.jsRob Scalera | 2024",p5.js

Pure Automatism Simulator,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/pure-automatism-simulator,working,"FULL TITLE:Pure Automatism Simulator. Human, as part of a generative algorithm, generates their own unconscious abstraction based on another abstraction generated by the algorithm.DESCRIPTIONThis project is a new step in the exploration of automatism in art, a method in which the creation of works occurs without conscious control, allowing a person's unconscious to influence the creative process. But how is it possible to disable consciousness if the Homo Creator inevitably realizes and naturally controls what they create? Art history knows numerous physically crafted techniques of automatism, from André Breton to Jackson Pollock; the Pure Automatism Simulator project offers a completely new, generative-oriented approach to examining this issue.Here's how:The consciousness of the user-creator is redirected to performing a simple task unrelated to the process of creating an artwork, and the creation of the artwork, which occurs at the same time, remains in the realm of the unconscious.It sounds confusing :) But it's actually quite simple.The algorithm generates a canvas with an animated abstract image, which includes, among other things, elements in the form of bars. A double click starts the simulation, the bars begin to extend, and the viewer's task is to move the cursor to the edges of the bars and make them retract. At this moment, the cursor's trajectory is captured, and after the simulation-animation ends and the bars stop extending, another part of the algorithm visualizes the recorded trajectory using an algorithmic brush. By pressing and holding on the canvas, you can view the unconsciously created artwork.A double click starts a new simulation cycle.This process allows for the creation of unique abstract compositions with each iteration, which will depend not only on how the bars happen to extend (which is random each time), but also on the user's attention, mood, and reaction.____________________________INSRUCTIONS for creating your unconscious painting:1. Double-click on the canvas to start the Simulator.2. Move the cursor to the edges of the extending bars, causing them to retract.3. Once the Simulator has finished (the bars stop extending), long-press to review the result - an abstraction created by you unconsciously.4. To save the result, press one of the buttons a, s, d, or f, depending on the desired resolution (a - min, f - max). The upper layer can be saved with the q, w, e, or r.5. Double-click on the canvas to restart the Simulator.Changing animation dynamics and duration: ⇧⇩ for dynamics and ⇦ ⇨ for duration.For printing the lower layer (your unconscious abstraction): Press 't' before saving to disable textures and set the full brightness range.",Unknown

Lightweight Deconstruction,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/lightweight-deconstruction,working,"Lightweight Deconstruction tells a story of architectural materiality with a sci-fi twist. It asks, quite literally, “what if Gottfried Semper’s Four Elements of Architecture were in fact elemental?” Taking cues from scientific visualization, the project imagines a series of laboratory-synthesized architectural elements that correspond loosely to those identified by Semper in his 1851 book. Here, “Roof,” “Mound,” “Hearth,” and “Enclosure” are represented as microscopic photographs or CT scans of ethereal assemblies, suggesting an alternative reading of these classical tropes. If materials always tell stories, we’re interested in the new kinds of stories that virtual/digital materials can tell beyond appliqués or textures. From a technical point of view, the project explores concepts of lightness in two ways: (1) in terms of volumetric representation and (2) in terms of data size. While typical digital rendering techniques represent materials as surface images applied to geometry through a UV map, this project puts forth a volumetric approach to material visualization. Lightweight Deconstruction substitutes typical surface raytracing algorithms with a custom-built volumetric raytracing engine that renders uncanny, vaporous, lightweight volumes. The resulting software is compressed and optimized to approximately 30kb, addressing the second interest in “lightweight” assemblies: data. The small software size allows the project to be portable and accessible, concerns that are increasingly important in the era of big data.Lightweight Deconstruction is part of an ongoing project we call ""Lightweight Construction"" that questions the relationship between virtual and physical materials while finding new kinships between them. It acts as a critical response to ongoing dialogues of digital models and their perceptions in design disciplines. Today, it is common to hear the virtual world described as a mirror world, and digital buildings are referred to as “digital twins.” While these may be apt ways to familiarize oneself with these mediums, they still skirt the core contradictions at play in virtual/digital space. We believe that contradictions are not hindrances but opportunities for richer forms of engagement. These projects embrace contradictions and test their limits through distinct material explorations in virtual space. Together, the projects that make up ""Lightweight Construction"" form a conceptual triptych that forces us to think deeper about pixels, voxels, and their narrative potentials.Usage:Press ‘s’ to save a screenshot.Double-click/tap to pause and continue rendering.Press ‘p’ to pause rotation and rendering.Press ‘1’, ‘2’, ‘3’, ‘0’ to zoom in/out.Disclaimer:This project uses WebGL2 and is GPU intensive.

BITXO [🎧],https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/bitxo-1,working,"""Bitxo""by @poperbu_Bitxo is a work created to be presented at the Digital Art Festival ""Responsive Dreams Festival 2024""""Bitxo"" (bug in Catalan) is a generative work of art that combines visual and audio elements to provide an immersive and impactful experience. This piece is a personal creation that explores and represents the way a mental illness, in this particular case an addiction, can affect all aspects of a life.Visual Aspects: The visual part of ""Bitxo"" is composed of dynamic patterns and changing colors that evolve unpredictably, reflecting the chaotic and uncontrolled nature of an addiction. The shapes and colors seem to be in constant motion, creating a sense of unease and confusion. The use of light and shadow helps create stark contrasts that symbolize the emotional ups and downs associated with this condition. All visuals are generated in real-time using p5.js technology, so no experience is the same, underscoring the unpredictability of living with an addiction.Sound Aspects: The sound component of ""Bitxo"" is based on generative sounds that evolve together with the visuals. The sounds can range from soft, harmonious tones to shrill, dissonant noises, creating a soundtrack that reflects the inner turmoil and emotional conflict of a person struggling with addiction. There is no pre-rendered or pre-recorded sound; the entire soundscape is generated in real time using Pure Data and WebPd technologies. Sound patterns are synchronized with the visuals, increasing immersion and providing an auditory representation of the visual experience.Interactivity and modalities: The work ""Bitxo"" has two modes of reproduction. In the fully automatic and autonomous mode, the work is generated and evolves without external intervention, highlighting the unpredictability and self-sufficiency of the creative process. In the interactive mode, the viewer can control different aspects of the work (life) and the 'bitxo' by means of a MIDI device (Korg NanoKontrol and NanoKontrol2), as well as by keyboard. This interactivity allows the viewer to influence the visual and sound evolution, representing the attempt to control and manage an addiction.Personal message: ""Bitxo"" is a deeply personal work that wants to communicate how a mental illness, in this case an addiction, can infiltrate and affect all aspects of a life. The piece shows how this condition can distort perception, alter emotions and unbalance everyday life. It is an artistic representation of the constant struggle and effort to maintain control in the face of a destabilizing force. With ""Bitxo"", the artist seeks not only to express his own experience, but also to generate empathy and understanding towards those in similar situations, offering a window into the inner world of a person affected by addiction.Part of Responsive Dreams 2024 Festival5/6/7 September 2024Nau Dents de Serra, Roca Umbert Fàbrica de les Arts, Granollers, BarcelonaMore info: responsivedreams.com-NOTES:-not recomended for sound sensitive persons.-100% code generated (no images or sounds preloaded)-All audio stuff is done with WebPd (PureData). https://github.com/sebpiq/WebPd-All visual is done with p5js -> https://p5js.org-MIDI stuff is done with WebMidi.js -> https://webmidijs.org-MIDI does not work with frames-> open the work in a new tab/window.-Chrome browser recommended.-MIDI compatible browsers -> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_MIDI_API#browser_compatibility-It is recommended to use high quality sound equipment or headphones.-Supply can be halved/reduced if all iterations have not been minted (every week aprox).",p5.js

Primordial Soup,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/primordial-soup-2,working,"""Primordial soup"" is a term used to describe the hypothetical mixture of organic molecules that existed in the early Earth's oceans or other bodies of water, from which life is thought to have originated. This concept is a key component of theories about abiogenesis, which is the natural process of life arising from non-living matter.From this perspective, I like to think that randomness isn't just chaos; it's the raw material of creativity and complexity, much like the primordial soup was to the emergence of life. The generative algorithm acts as a guiding force, much like natural selection, which gradually shapes order from disorder. By filtering through countless possibilities, it discards those that cannot sustain themselves and nurtures those that show potential.Well-known noise functions serve as the groundwork, a fertile environment where patterns can emerge and evolve. They are the in-between state, not yet fully formed into something recognizable, but not entirely random either—just like the early molecules in the primordial soup, driven by chemical reactions towards more complex arrangements.Imagine these organic variants as seeds of potential, each with the possibility to grow into a new form of existence. Just as single-celled organisms once evolved into complex life forms, these primordial patterns, guided by the algorithm, could develop into intricate structures, digital ecologies, or even virtual ecosystems. They may give rise to digital 'organisms,' capable of self-replication, adaptation, or perhaps even rudimentary forms of perception and interaction.In this digital primordial soup, every bit of noise has the potential to become something greater. It's a playground for the formation of virtual life, where each small mutation, each random iteration, could lead to breakthroughs, much like how the first self-replicating molecules eventually paved the way for the vast diversity of life we see today.Made with love and p5js.Please enjoy in live fullscreen mode.Controls in fullscreen:[1] - save PNG 4000 × 2666[2] - save PNG 8000 × 5332[3] - save PNG 12000 × 7998[4] - save PNG 16000 × 10664",p5js

Magma,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/magma-2,working,"This collection explores the generation of ""all"" 2D patterns of bitwise operators on a finite set of symbols.The algorithm will randomly pick, based on the contract seed, one integer smaller than 9007199254740991, this integer uniquely defines a bitwise operator. The minter controls 4 independent parameters: the numeral system base (finite set of symbols), and the fractal roughness. Fractal roughness is controlled by two parameters: the base and the exponent of the coarse graining operator. All these values are given as features once the NFT is minted.Surprisingly no fine tuning of the parameters where needed. Limiting the interval range of the allowed parameters values was the only aesthetically restriction imposed, mainly due to fxhash's variation algorithm. Because not all the parameters give good patterns some mild restrictions was needed. Other beautiful, but rare, spatial patterns exists on the far side of the parameters universe, but that's for another day.The algorithm is deterministic because it is based on deterministic bitwise operations on a finite alphabet. The list of all bitwise operators is called magma, hence the name of this NFT collection [1].One of the visual appealing parameters of the algorithm is the roughness exponent which is closely related to the fractal nature of the patterns produced. This roughness exponent shapes the resulting spatial pattern morphology, larger values of the exponent leads to coarser patterns, the inverse also happens, lower values of the roughness exponent leads to finer detail. These mathematically structures, patchwork quilts, are fractals with self-affine properties arising by simple bitwise operations between numbers.Colors are generated by converting the bitwise operator hyper-surface levels values to the 16777216 RGB color values in two ways.Also implemented is a coarse grain operator (CGO) that permits to morphologically zoom in and out of the pattern. The coarse grain operator has two parameters: a scale, parameter 'CGO scale' and an exponent, 'CGO exponent', that roughly specifies the magnitude of the coarse grain operator. 'CGO scale' equal to 1 (one) disables the coarse operator.Happy hacking!Completeness and determinism in algorithms are aesthetically categories that push into the limit of what can be described, fragile pedestals for our random existence.----[1] Vladimir García-Morales, Fractal surfaces from simple arithmetic operations,Physica A, Volume 447, 2016,Pages 535-544 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2015.12.028)Minting InstructionsBase: numeral systemRoughness: roughness exponentCGO scale: scale of the coarse grain operator (1=disables coarse operator)CGO exponent: magnitude of the coarse grain operatorOther palette: choose between two color palettesPress 's' to save a PNG (8192x8192px).",Unknown

Idle/Interludes,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/idleinterludes-1,working,"‘Idle/Interludes’ draws inspiration from the avant-garde experiments of 20th-century visual and concrete poetry, where the visual arrangement of text played an integral part in the poem’s meaning. Words transformed into shapes, with their physical presence on the page becoming as significant as their semantic content.The genesis of 'Idle/Interludes' began with my typewriter experiments. These early works sparked a deeper fascination with glyph compositions. I then reproduced the work using code to delve into dichotomous reflections. Open-source typewriter fonts, such as ‘Patrician’ and ‘Oliver Printype,’ became my building blocks.As the forms evolved, so did the phrases, mirroring the shapes. This iterative process—where brief, often binary or resonant phrases nest within a sea of glyphs—led to the continual addition and subtraction of patterns, letters, and symbols. Sometimes, these phrases stemmed from my personal experiences or the serendipity of phonetically or phonologically similar words. The idea lent itself well to generative art because of the malleability of language.The concept of visual poetry is especially powerful within the context of a book.

Knota Tessellation,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/knota-tessellation,working,"Inspired by the intricate patterns of Celtic knotwork, ""Knota Tessellation"" is a generative artwork that employs a grid-based structure. The composition consists of two fundamental tile shapes: a straight line with side margins and an elbow shape with margins. An algorithm strategically places these tiles within the grid, selecting a tile type and applying a random rotation to each placement. This approach results in a visually cohesive composition where individual tiles seamlessly merge to form a larger, unified pattern.To enhance the visual depth and complexity of the artwork, a background layer is initially rendered using half-sized tiles. These background tiles are assigned colors based on their relative position within a color space defined by four randomly selected corner colors.

By running this program in your browser, you become the potential discoverer of new and previously unseen forms. Once the program starts, the autonomous algorithm will endlessly generate and interact with spatial configurations involving 15000+ elements.If a particular configuration catches your eye, press the SPACE bar to begin your exploration. The autonomous algorithm will pause, giving you the freedom to examine the structure from all angles, including from within.Your exploration vessel is equipped with two tools, accessible via the LEFT and RIGHT mouse clicks. These “entropy operators” allow you to interact with the structure's order. The left-click decreases the system’s entropy (increasing its order), while the right-click disturbs the elements along the operator’s path.Each time the program is launched, a similar experimental setup is generated, but with some unique characteristics. For example, we are working on developing an external non-perturbative light condenser (not an easy task!), but it doesn’t always function as expected.Additionally, the entropy operator accessed via left-click presents two variations: automatic or manual. In EXPLORE mode an entropy gauge appears in the lower-left corner of your screen. When the value reaches <0.01 nJ a new structure becomes available. We are also developing an automatic entropy operator, but it is only available in certain iterations.To switch between automatic and manual modes, simply restart the program with a new hash.This may all seem a bit random, and we apologize for any confusion. This new technology is still in its infancy, but rest assured that the entropy operators presented here are the most advanced currently available in the galaxy.By activating this program, you become the master of a unique physical experiment, where each observation could challenge the current state of knowledge. If you observe anything unusual or if a particular specimen seems noteworthy, feel free to take a screenshot using the ENTER key and submit it to us for further study. We encourage you to share the results of your observations and interactions by using the hashtag #thephaseexperience. A specialist may be able to provide additional insights.A final note: due to quantum instabilities, the currently observed structure may vanish when exiting EXPLORATION mode. The autonomous algorithm will resume, and new structures will emerge.Please note that the program's authors bear no responsibility for any damage resulting from improper use of the software or its consequences.We hope you make fascinating discoveries and remain at your disposal for any questions.Kind regards,H-----LIVE : An autonomous algorithm creates an infinite number of structures.

ANSITUNES,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/ansitunes,working,"My earliest exposure to digital art was viewing ANSI art on bulletin board systems, a scrolling, text-based experience over a slow dial-up connection. There's something alluring about the simplicity of a limited color palette rendered with 80 character columns of text. The computers back then were restricted to primitive hardware. Graphics cards could only render 256 colors at a time. Sound cards used on-board oscillators to produce a finite number of sound waves. And yet the creative genius of programmers pushed these limitations to magnificent results.ANSITUNES attempts to capture the spirit of that time. Using an elementary cellular automaton as the impetus, ASCII characters based on the code page 437 character set are rendered in VGA colors, and a chiptunes-style music score is generated using synth oscillators and noise algorithms. As the ANSI art scrolls, the music plays the ECA-generated song. Click or tap anywhere on ANSITUNES to start the song.On desktop, there are a number of keyboard commands available:[?] Show or hide the Help screen[SPACE] Play or pause ANSITUNES[M] Mute or unmute the audio[F] Toggle Fullscreen mode[C] Toggle the CRT effect[T] Export a TXT file (7680 rows max)[P] Export a PNG high resolution file (2560x1920)[W] Start and stop recording a WEBM audio file recording (3m max)ANSITUNES is built entirely with code, using p5.js, Tone.js, JavaScript, and GLSL.",p5.js

Elliott Waves,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/elliott-waves,working,"This generative artwork, created using p5.js, is a sophisticated fusion of art, financial theory, and machine learning, designed to visualize and explore the intricate dynamics of financial markets through the lens of Elliott Wave Theory. Each piece produced by this code is more than just a visual artifact; it's a meticulously crafted, unique visual dataset ideal for training AI models in market analysis and prediction.Technical Overview:The core of the artwork is based on Elliott Wave Theory, a fundamental concept in technical analysis that posits markets move in predictable, wave-like patterns. The code generates these waves with random variations in height and width, emulating the inherent volatility and unpredictability of real-world market prices.Wave Generation: The code creates Elliott Waves by iterating over 360 days, where each day is represented by a small segment of the wave. Randomness is introduced in the direction and magnitude of the wave's movement, mimicking the erratic yet patterned behavior seen in financial markets.Candlestick Chart: To enhance the realism, the code generates weekly candlesticks, each representing a week's worth of data. The open, close, high, and low prices for each week are determined randomly, providing a visual representation of the market's fluctuations.Axes and Labels: The artwork is structured with a temporal x-axis marked by months and a quantitative y-axis indicating price levels. These axes not only provide context but are also essential for making the dataset relevant for AI training in temporal sequence prediction and financial forecasting.Randomness and Control: Randomness in this code is not merely a visual effect but a critical aspect of the data-driven approach. The randomness is carefully controlled to reflect the chaotic yet patterned nature of financial markets, making each iteration of the artwork a valuable and unique dataset.User Interaction:The code also includes a simple yet powerful user interaction feature: pressing the 's' key allows the user to save the current state of the artwork as a PNG file. This ensures that each unique iteration can be preserved for further study, display, or use in AI-driven applications.Applications:This generative artwork is not just a static piece; it's a dynamic, evolving dataset that serves multiple purposes:AI Training: The visual data produced is ideal for training AI models in market behavior, prediction, and analysis.Financial Analysis: The generated patterns and candlestick data can be used to explore and understand market dynamics.Artistic Expression: Each iteration of the code creates a visually compelling representation of market theory, bridging the gap between art and science.Conclusion:In this project, the randomness integrated into the artwork serves as a crucial component in emulating the behavior of financial markets. The result is a dynamic and evolving piece that not only stands as a visual masterpiece but also as a sophisticated dataset, ready to be used in AI-driven marketing strategies, financial analysis, and beyond.

Feature Initialization:   - Background color is chosen randomly from a predefined set.   - The number of lines is randomized for varied visual density.   - The number of colors used in each piece is also randomized, adding to the variability and uniqueness of each creation.3. Line Attributes:   - Line widths vary within a specified range, with additional random adjustments.   - Line colors use the HSL model, varying around a base hue for harmony. The number of distinct colors is randomized, creating a diverse color palette for each piece.4. Fibonacci Sequence Integration:   - Frequencies for sine waves are selected from the first 21 Fibonacci numbers.   - Up to 25 sine functions with random Fibonacci frequencies create complex visuals.5. Dynamic Motion:   - Subtle random translations create a drifting effect, enhancing fluidity.   - Randomly chosen directions for motion add to the sense of randomness and organic movement.6. Rendering:   - Background is reset each frame, and lines are drawn influenced by the sum of multiple sine waves.   - Vertical positions and line widths are dynamically adjusted within constraints.7. Color Harmony:   - Line colors adjust slightly in each frame to maintain harmony and vibrancy.   - The lightness of each line's color varies, adding a subtle vibrancy to the visual output.",p5.js

The device was constantly shifting and warping time in a way that they had never seen before. They could see moments from the past and future all at once, as if time was a fluid substance that it could manipulate at will.Even in the last few days before the rapture, when it was already clear that their own perception of time was being distorted, the consensus was that the device simply was some sort of particle analyzer.

It was causing tiny ripples in time that were slowly spreading throughout their world.They never really understood what happened to them.[…]–On display are 32 slices of rotating particles, caught in a finite time fragment. Each slice has an on and off state, which is controlled by the device. The device contains a piece of grid material that disperses energy.

In ""Twilight Blossoms,"" the goal was to capture the serenity and splendor of twilight through an explosion of colors and soft forms. The choice of crimson and orange tones for the sky aims to evoke the warmth and intensity of the setting sun, while the blues and greens in the flowers and landscape create a contrast that highlights the freshness of nature at dusk.The objective of ""Twilight Blossoms"" is to explore how technology can capture and express the ephemeral beauty of nature. Through code, the aim was not only to replicate a natural scene but also to infuse it with a sense of wonder and novelty. Each execution of the code can produce unique variations of the work, making each generated twilight as unique as those occurring in reality.This piece is a tribute to the fusion between human creativity and algorithmic precision, demonstrating that digital art can be both a tool for personal expression and a platform for infinite creative exploration.S: Save image in PNGI hope you like my first release on ETH(base),thank you all!",Unknown

The canvas is initially divided into irregular, tessellated sections through a randomized process of dividing its edges into integer units. These sections are then further subdivided recursively, creating a complex network of interlocking spaces.Within each resulting space, a vibrant background color, reminiscent of Andy Warhol's iconic pop art palette, is applied. Overlaid on this background are four black ellipses, meticulously positioned to create a dynamic interplay of positive and negative space. The ellipses are carefully arranged to form a concentric-like pattern, allowing the underlying color to shine through in unexpected and visually striking ways.This interplay between the structured grid and the organic forms of the ellipses results in a piece that is both meticulously calculated and visually arresting.

quantum | 1,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/quantum-or-1,working,"----- Generative art as a physics lesson: Superposition ------- What is Quantum Superposition? Quantum superposition is the principle that a quantum system can exist in multiple states at the same time until it is measured. Imagine a cat that is both alive and dead simultaneously until you open the box to check—this is known as Schrödinger's cat, a famous thought experiment. What is a Qubit? A qubit is the basic unit of quantum information, similar to a bit in classical computing. Unlike a bit, which can be either 0 or 1, a qubit can be in a superposition of both 0 and 1. This property allows quantum computers to perform complex calculations more efficiently. Superposition in Quantum Computing Quantum superposition enables quantum computers to process a vast amount of information simultaneously. While a classical computer processes bits sequentially, a quantum computer can perform operations on all possible states of qubits at once. This parallelism gives quantum computers the potential to solve certain problems much faster than classical computers.By harnessing the power of quantum superposition, scientists and engineers are developing new technologies that could revolutionize industries and solve previously intractable problems.The artwork is an example of my representation of the quantum world.",Unknown

Revealed Secret,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/revealed-secret,working,"""Revealed Secret” is a generative art project that delves into the beauty and complexity that emerges when we look past the surface.  Our brains are trained to make quick judgements about people and things in order to assess danger and keep us safe.  But if we set aside our fear and take more time, we see that things are more complex and wonderous than they seemed at first.  The surface is blessedly broken and the hidden layers peak through to produce a fine tapestry of reality.  The project begins with a shader that creates three layers of Perlin noise.  An optional second shader smears the colors.  Then selected shapes are used to erase parts of the top two layers.  I’m delighted to finally use my own shaders to create art.  I’m borrowing shader noise code from Inigo Quilez and shader random code from Patricio Gonzalez Vivo.

Each iteration triggers an editor, allowing users to set parameters like the number of notes in a chord, the duration of the longest note, and the frequency range between notes.

You can select from 5 to 50 notes.Frequency of the Root Note: Set the frequency of the root note, which is the starting note of your chord. This can range from 2 Hz to 500 Hz.Minimum Step Between Notes: Define the smallest possible random frequency difference between notes in your chord, ranging from 1 Hz to 500 Hz.Maximum Step Between Notes: Define the largest possible random frequency difference between notes in your chord, ranging from 1 Hz to 500 Hz.Duration of the Longest Note: Set how long the longest note in the chord will last.Loudness (chordLoudness): Adjust the volume of your chord.Tips for Composing Interesting ChordsVariety in Note Count: Experiment with different numbers of notes. A chord with 5 notes will sound much simpler in timbre compared to one with 50 notes, which can create a richer, more complex sound, but chords with less notes can be more striking for the harmony created by their intervals. Thus, the tradeoff is between the focus on timbre and the focus on harmony.Root Note Frequency: Use lower root note frequencies for deeper, bass-heavy chords, and higher frequencies for a lighter, more treble-focused sound.Steps Between Notes:Set a small minStep and maxStep to create closely spaced notes (possibly creating the beating effect). Use larger steps for a more open chord.Duration: Vary the duration of the longest note to change the feel of the chord. Shorter durations can make the piece feel more rhythmic and staccato, while longer durations add a more sustained and ambient quality.Loudness: Adjust the volume to create dynamics in your composition. Softer chords can be gentle and soothing, while louder chords can add intensity and presence. You cannot control the volumes of individual notes, which is (fxhash)-random. Just the general volume of the chord.Ideas for Composing a SequenceBuild Gradually: Start with fewer notes and lower loudness, gradually increasing these parameters with each new chord to create a building effect.Dynamic Shifts: Alternate between chords with high and low loudness or short and long durations to create contrast and keep the composition engaging.Harmonic Exploration: Experiment with different rootNote frequencies and steps between notes to explore various harmonic landscapes, from consonant to dissonant.Repeat: keep the params of the previous chords in multiple further iterations to maintain and evolve certain qualities of the musical fragment minted so far.By thoughtfully manipulating these parameters, you can craft a unique and evolving musical piece, contributing to a collaborative and continuous composition.",Three.js

In the artfork, sinusoids and squares intersect, so we will talk about these waveforms.- Sine wave:A sine wave looks like a smooth, wavy line that rises and falls in a regular rhythm. It can be thought of as a perfect wave on water when there is no wind or other disturbances. It has smooth curves and no sharp changes. Such waves are often found in nature and technology. For example, the sound we hear and the electric current in our homes are mostly sinusoidal in shape.- Rectangular wave:A rectangular wave, on the other hand, looks like an alternation of straight horizontal lines that go up or down sharply. Imagine that you turn off and on the light in the room: either there is light, or there is no light. A square wave works in a similar way - it instantly changes its state from high to low and vice versa. This is often used in digital engineering and electronics, where signals need to be clear and understandable, such as ""on"" or ""off"".Is it strange that in the description of waves and physics we use the concepts of ellipse and rectangle?

I thought to myself, ""What if one of these doors could be like a hanging scroll of a landscape painting in the garden?The afterimage of the tape that peeled off the poster is like a wisteria trellis,Raindrops and shoe prints might look like flowers and grass in the garden.I fancied that the doors of the nearest station were like looking at a painting, and I stood there again and again.I disturbed the station staff for a long time.The passage of time moving in the direction of decay and fading,only by the replacement of colors,may be transformed into a growth process in which the plant is growing toward flowering.With this idea in mind, I started writing the code.A palette based on the colors of a garden, such as a Japanese garden, an English garden, etc., selected by random values,A palette reminiscent of a nightscape, a monochrome palette,palette that represents the deterioration of a door as it is.The palette is selected based on the colors of the garden, such as Japanese garden, English garden, etc.Four time modes are randomly selected: ""new"", ""normal"", ""old"", and ""vintage"".The number of events will change accordingly.Vintage has the most events.Every animation starts for about 1700 frames.You can save the png freely with the ""s"" key.This work was written in p5.js.I look forward to seeing a lot of output results.Thank you very much.Asahamiz",p5.js

Each parameter choice significantly alters the visual composition, allowing endless variations of orbital paths that evoke the unpredictable nature of cosmic interactions.As bodies glide across the digital canvas, trails linger to mark the paths traveled, slowly fading like the memory of a shooting star.

Then some information will be shown+ THE HOTKEYS.<<Naturally, you've just launched the program, and what you're seeing might strike you as ""pretty funny."" If you're looking for more than just ""funny,"" delve into the notes on 'hexBOTs.'At its core lies a grid, a parquet of equilateral triangles (seamlessly). This grid can also be transformed into a rectangular grid. This allows the slightly distorted representation of the triangle parquet to seamlessly integrate with the display grid.Now, considering a grid point of the triangle parquet, you find yourself amidst a center of six other grid points, positioning themselves in regular hexagons. In their center sits a robot surrounded by 6 points - hence the name 'Hexbot.'These robots move on this grid. They must always algorithmically choose one of the surrounding points as a new base point.The Track Module:Before a robot moves to the next grid point, it marks the point where it currently resides. Thus, a 'trail' is formed. These trails, along with others, paint the picture. However, the actual trail of the robot is not on the canvas but in its memory. After some time, the robot forgets its trail - it dissolves. The forgetfulness behavior of the trail is robot-specific and determined by the random generator. There are both weak and strong memory capacities. Everything will be forgotten!The Move Module:A robot now analyzes its 6 peripheral points, here, two of which are designated as trail-points. It reads 'false, false, true, true, false, false' or '001100' - binary = 12-decimal. The value 12 represents the index in the movement list of the robot - at this index in a fixed list stands, for example, 'Move to top left.' In total, there are always 64 list positions (0 - 63 / counting zero!), because with a 6-digit binary value, precisely the decimal numbers 0-63 can be defined. There are exactly six movement instructions: left, right, top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right. These movement instructions are arranged in various variations in the 64-line movement list. Their positions are determined by the random generator. All possibilities result in a large number!The Stuck Module:The fact that a robot 'gets stuck' is a regular occurrence. Getting stuck can also manifest as a series of movements repeating periodically. If the Stuck Module recognizes motionlessness or a repetitive dance without progress, it triggers the 'Free Ride Mechanism.'10 to the power of 64 Robot Types:It was my decision NOT to host a TALENT SHOW to isolate 100 super-good robots. This results in the drawn pictures not always being so great, or often 'Dumb Robots' are on the playing field. Isolating only a few robot types would, however, have LOST A HUGE DIVERSITY! So: It doesn't always have to be a super show, but there are always new surprises! I want 10 to the power of 64 robots to have the chance to make their appearance!About the Program:A maximum of 53 robots are allowed. There have been instances where 24 different types were on the playing field. Various robots are deployed. The first robot is Type=0. When another robot is added, it becomes Type=1. If the same robot is added again, it also becomes Type=1. A brand-new robot is added - voilà Type=2 etc... etc... The programming of the types is different in each experiment. This means that identical types are completely different in different experiments.The concept of the entire event is perhaps a kind of 'jumble' of 'Game of Life' & 'Ants' + 'other grid-based designs.' In short: It's all stolen!Everything runs synchronously / one after the other - no parallel executions.My best regardsM. Schoenenberger>>",p5.js

Fragile Errors,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/fragile-errors,working,"""Art stands in a fragile balance; it reflects both its fragility and its strength.""Lucy Lippard In art, the concept of ""fragile"" emphasizes the delicate, sensitive, and brittle nature of works. This fragility can manifest in both the physical structure of the art and its emotional and conceptual depth. Additionally, the inclusion of mistakes and unexpected events in the artistic process lends a spontaneous and authentic quality to the pieces. These unplanned and uncontrolled errors can sometimes become the most powerful and impactful elements of the work. They reflect the fragility of the pieces and the complexity of the human experience, drawing the viewer more deeply into the inner world of the artwork. Ultimately, the concept of ""fragile"" and the spontaneous images created by mistakes are crucial elements that enhance originality and emotional depth in art. In this collection, I introduced a digital texture to my new compositions. I enveloped the resulting structures with an innovative layer and arranged the images spontaneously created by these textures in an interactive manner. I kept my color palette limited in this collection; I chose contrasting colors because textures become invisible in similar hues. During my resolution tests, I experienced significant texture loss at high levels, so I decided to work at an optimal resolution. This way, I aim to preserve both the visual richness and the artistic integrity of my works.*Save image: press 'W' to save the current image as a PNG.*Fullscreen mode: press 'E'------------------------------------------------------------------Fragile Errors © 2024 by NUBPLUS is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0",Unknown

Ode to Gestalt,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/ode-to-gestalt,working,"Ode to Gestalt is a mesmerizing exploration of form and color, reminiscent of the Bauhaus movement. The artwork is built upon a foundation of squares, each meticulously tessellated using three distinct shapes: a half-round, a quarter-round, and a petal.A vibrant palette of eight ""Bauhaus"" colors fuels the generative process. Four colors are randomly chosen to create a unique subset for each iteration. This subset then dictates the visual symphony: one color fills the background square, while another is selected to render one of the three shapes on top. The intrigue lies in the possibility of the background and shape aligning in color, causing the form to seemingly vanish, leaving behind a pristine square.The result is a captivating dance of color and form. Contiguous shapes, united by a shared hue, coalesce into intriguing structures, echoing the principles of Gestalt psychology. These emergent formations evoke the spirit of Bauhaus, where form and function found harmonious expression.Adding a touch of interactivity, pressing the space bar breathes new life into the artwork, presenting a fresh arrangement of colors and shapes.

Thank you LoneWick for the challenge!The creative prompt made me think immediately of parasites, some of which get ingested in order to then devour their host from within. Applying conceptual simplification leads to the idea of self-parasitism where host and parasite are one and the same.One visual metaphor for this is the Ouroboros - the serpent that eats its own tail. For this project I've tried to merge an abstract version of Ouroboros with the Japanese symbol of ensō. In Zen Buddhism, ensō represents the circle of enlightenment, the void, and the infinite nature of existence. It is often depicted as an incomplete circle, symbolizing the idea that imperfection is an essential part of existence and perfection. Drawing ensō is a practice of spiritual reflection, self-expression, and mindfulness. It often reflects the state of the artist's mind at the moment of creation.Some compositions also show nested symbols of alternating colors. This, together with the broken circle which suggests a mouth, illustrates the phrase in another manner.--------------------------This is a 100% code generated project.Copyright 2024 Jeff Clark--------------------------Custom code created by Jeff Clark using standard javascript.",Unknown
Bit Operations,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/bit-operations,working,"🔈 Click for Sound 🔈Bit Operations is an visual exploration of computer fundamentals through bit-shifting operations. The visuals are generated by continuously shifting and combining binary patterns, resulting in evolving compositions of stark pixels and geometric shapes. The accompanying audio components are synthesized from this same modulating bit data.At its core, the piece is driven by algorithms that perform bit-shifting - the simple acts of pushing binary values left or right within the computer's memory. By combining multiple shifting patterns together in different ways, complex permutations of light and dark visuals emerge. The audio reflects these same bit-level operations, with the rhythms and tones mapping directly to the shifts occurring in the data.Through this formal process focused on bit-shifting, the piece lays bare the fundamental building blocks of how modern computers operate under the hood. It reduces computational logic to its most essential level - the manipulation of 1s and 0s through rudimentary shift operations.

Recently I have been blessed with a good doctor and medication and am recovering quite well, but it is not completely gone. But I am still able to type and create! It's wonderful. Whether I wanted to or not, my life was not going well. On top of that, the world was a mess. I wanted to fight, to raise my voice, but obstacles prevented me from doing so.

It’s a visual metaphor for the idea that within every orderly arrangement lies the potential for unpredictability and change.The play of light and shadow, along with the use of perspective, gives the impression of movement and transformation, suggesting that the depicted forms are in a state of flux.. The work is not just a visual experience but also a metaphorical inquiry into the dynamics of order and entropy.",p5.js

When You're Alone.,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/when-you're-alone.,working,"I spend a lot of my time alone. I like it.This project is part drawing system, part isometric challenge, and part artwork.The artwork is pleasantly laid out before the viewer as an empty city of thousands of buildings slowly comes to fruition for the imagination to fill.The drawing system is showcased through a keyboard accessible menu (press the [m] key) where you can fine-tune how well, or badly, you want your city drawn. You'll notice the menu auto-updating to conform to the new drawing parameters as you change them. Initially I planned to have random drawing parameters assigned per edition, but found myself gravitating towards a cleaner look so often, I decided to make it the default, so the collection was more cohesive across outputs, and include controls within the piece for alternate versions, (for better or worse drawing skills) if you so choose. The menu system for this is a nice addition I think as well. NFTs can be so much more than just a jpeg.Conventions have been made for removing the hatch lines (press [h] to toggle during drawing) as well as a pointillism feature (press [.] to toggle during drawing) for fun.When You're Alone is entirely drawn with straight lines.

It can overcome a lot, and can not be overcome by much.Concentration - This decides how long the computer can hold a straight line without drifting one way or the other along the path.Pen Pressure Consistency - The more consistent, the more even the weight of the line will be. Less consistent lines will appear more broken, especially when combined with a fast drawing speed. This may be a look that is appealing or not.Drawing Speed - This sort of bleeds into all of the other variables and decides how much or little impact their relative weights have on the final product. In addition, the slower the drawing, the more ink that bleeds onto the page giving a darker look to the drawing.Pen Nib Size - The actual size of the pen tip/nib that the computer will use.

ConcretionX144X160,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/concretionx144x160,working,"This new collection, a collaboration between Sha22, Fleurman & Raoul Pictor, is unveiled at the Mapping Festival Geneva 2024.In “ConcretionX144X160” Raoul Pictor explores the expressive potential of pixels in a 144 x 160 pixel format with four shades, reminiscent of the legendary Game Boy console. These pixels not only delineate the physical framework of the work; they also create the world in which Raoul lives and works.Represented with his computer, Raoul becomes the symbol of an era where the artist and the tool merge into one. Coded to code, Pictor reflects the recursive loop of digital creation where the virtual artist, himself a series of commands and scripts, generates art through his own programming language. He challenges the acronym WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) by revealing an art of programming where the final artwork remains hidden behind the veil of code. He is both the brush and the painter, the algorithm and the craftsman, exploring the boundaries of a reality where the tangible and intangible coexist. The distinction between creator and creation dissolves in this digital space, prompting viewers to recognize art not only as the product of a process but also as an introspective reflection of the technology that shapes it.The generated creations juxtapose the virtual and the physical world through the depiction of a pixelated sculptural form, a concretion, made up of abstract three-dimensional elements that suggest the weight of traditional materials from our reality.Instructions:[p], [mouse click], [touch screen] : Save the painting when it is displayed.[esc], [double click on computer] : r.p. computer crashes",p5.js

Atomic Radiation,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/atomic-radiation,working,"Atomic Radiation: A Generative Exploration of Mid-Century ModernityA Fusion of Past and Present:This generative art piece, ""Atomic Radiation,"" reflects my fascination with Mid-Century Modern (MCM) design, a style that resonated deeply during my Industrial Design studies from 1965 to 1969. Revisiting this aesthetic serves as an exploration of my artistic roots and a celebration of the design influences that shaped me.Echoes of Modernism:MCM design drew heavily from modern movements like Scandinavian Design and the Bauhaus. It championed clean lines, honest use of materials, and a minimalist approach that shunned excessive ornamentation.Generative Interpretations:As a generative artist, I leverage the power of code to effortlessly create MCM design elements – think of them as artistic building blocks. These elements are then arranged in patterns or layouts, often utilizing tessellations (a method for creating seamless, interlocking patterns) inspired by György Kepes' ""Language of Vision"" – itself an embodiment of the Bauhaus philosophy within the MCM movement.The Art of the Algorithm:The backdrop of ""Atomic Radiation"" is a dynamic canvas. Its wavy structure incorporates subtle random variations while adhering to a limited palette reminiscent of Bauhaus color theory. Colors are randomly chosen, and the interplay of the oscillating vertical lines creates a mesmerizing visual effect. An overlay of atomic widgets, a quintessential MCM motif, forms a captivating, interlocking structure. Each widget, empowered by code and controlled randomness, becomes unique – distinct in color, number of orbits, and electron placement.A Dynamic Experience:The true magic of ""Atomic Radiation"" lies in its interactive nature. With a simple key press, the entire composition refreshes, generating a new, original piece of generative art.

This piece was created during the GW of 2024. Please consider the following note as a miscellaneous reflection born from heightened concentration during this period.Initially, on a whim, I was sketching the circular and radiating lines from Marcel Duchamp's ""The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even"" using p5js. I managed to reproduce the circular elements quite satisfactorily with algorithms and felt content with that.On another occasion, as a completely separate endeavor, I was experimenting with a technique of creating forms using a grid. With plenty of time during the holiday, I had ample opportunity for exploration. However, at one point, this formation somehow adopted a configuration reminiscent of ""The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even"". Intrigued, I decided to experiment by duplicating this formation, placing it both in the upper and lower halves. This resulted in the completion of this piece.Through this process, I feel I gained insight into Duchamp as a Generative Artist. His Rotoreliefs, naturally, along with his series of ""Nude Descending a Staircase"" and his interest in chess, all began to appear as facets of Generative Art. However, I fear this sensation may slip away if not acted upon promptly.

One evening, as twilight melded into the shadows, the whisper became a voice, and the Architect began to create something new.He worked through the night, guided not by his usual precise calculations but by a newfound rhythm that pulsed with the beat of his own heart. When dawn broke, the city awoke to a sight unseen: a singular building unlike any other, with blocks displaced and patterns disrupted.The ""Displaced"" building, as it came to be known, stood as an anomaly. Its asymmetry was a stark contrast to the uniformity of its neighbors. Whispers turned into conversations, and conversations into debates. The city was divided; many saw it as a flaw in the fabric of their perfect world, but for others, it was a revelation.Among the city's inhabitants was a young girl who had always felt out of place in the rigidity of her surroundings. To her, the ""Displaced"" was a symbol of hope, a message from the Architect that there was beauty in irregularity, and that it was okay to be different.The building sparked a movement. People started to add splashes of color to their homes, plant gardens of wildflowers in rigid rows, wear clothes that clashed with geometric precision. The city, once a monochrome of sameness, was now erupting with color and life.The ""Displaced"" stood as a testament to the beauty of imperfection and the power of a single act to inspire change. The Architect, once revered for his unwavering adherence to order, was now celebrated for his courage to imagine beyond it. And the young girl, who had found her reflection in the displaced blocks, became the Architect's apprentice, learning to build not just with her hands, but with her heart.The city had transformed, not into a place of perfect order, but into a mosaic of individuality, where every building had its story, every street its rhythm, and every life the freedom to find its unique pattern in the grand design. The ""Displaced"" was no longer an outlier but the cornerstone of a new world — one where every displacement was an opportunity for wonder, and every irregularity a doorway to possibility.—-Press [s] for .jpeg | Press [p] for .pngMade with p5.jsRob Scalera | 2024",p5.js

line.length-1,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/line.length-1,working,"Benjamin Franklin famously remarked that in this world, nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes. We have never quite managed to disprove him on the latter.At its core, death carries a straightforward definition: the complete cessation of life processes, an inevitable fate for all living organisms. While we grasp the technical definition, no one possesses the faintest notion of what occurs to an individual after they pass away.Personally, I've always been fascinated by the idea of death. Since I was a child, I've found myself empathizing with the suffering of others and who I am today has been shaped by the losses I've experienced in my life.To bring this project to life I gathered my thoughts and memories and I coded nightly to visually represent the felt experience of the mystery of death, intentionally using a single line to symbolize life's continuity, from start to finish.As the project progressed, I realized the multitude of perspectives surrounding the subject. From losing a loved one to facing our own demise, from being on death row to dying while saving someone else. Whether dying young or after a long, fulfilling life. The pain of losing a child, the weight of taking another's life, the grief of losing a pet, or even the simple act of killing a mosquito—what lies beyond? How long can an object hold a memory? Can it transcend the rituals of ceremony, the solemnity of cemeteries, the grandeur of mausoleums?I invited eight artist friends to participate in this project by contributing a short phrase, or poem capturing a facet of their feelings about death. I then visually riffed on each submission.There are a total of 16 different profiles, each appearing 5 times but never identical. Each output will enable its owner to redeem a physical plot at an additional cost. This means there could be a maximum of 5 signed and numbered plots for each profile in existence, all unique.I would like to express my deep gratitude to Atelier Art for organizing the Visual Poetry exhibition and assisting me every step of the way, both in helping me articulate what I truly wanted to convey and in executing the concept effectively.

Hash Pop,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/hash-pop,working,"Nothing speaks more to my passion for applied art than my desire to peruse consignment and antique shops over art galleries. There is something endlessly fascinating about the methods, colors, and use and placement of text on an old tobacco can, music album cover or package of matches. Nothing awakens my sense of artistic expression more than sifting through an old stack of mid-century magazines and postcards. Some see consumerism, I choose to see a curious mind and an artist expressing their unique styles. ‘Hash Pop’ is somewhat of a confession, and an embrace of my roots as a designer. It’s an expressive exploration of applied art design principles, particularly the use of simple shapes, symmetry, whitespace and typography. Colors and textures are rooted in pop art and various propaganda art styles inspired by Andy Warhol, Robert Litchenstein, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, and various creators of propaganda and product art.‘Hash Pop’ is an expressive exploration of these ideas. How can I as a studied designer create expressive implementations of applied art principles? How can I bridge the gap between these disciplines to create something purely for the sake of its creation rather than the confines of a specific purpose? The structure of ‘Hash Pop’ is premised on the hash, which is printed in a 5x10 grid, with the final character (51) printed as a highlight in the background. The hash is not only the most prominent feature of the artwork, it’s also a time stamp, cementing the space and the time where the creator and consumer met, in the era of the block chain. It’s a testament to our shared experience in this time and in this space. It’s an expression of our shared experience, and a visual poem of our path to get here.  There is no defined structure to the color palette, so the outputs are purposefully random. Textures and transparencies are designed to be subtle and are structured with printing in mind. Each piece when printed allows for paper textures and inks to add their unique elements to the final printed outputs. I find a particular satisfaction in printed artwork and test the printed outputs extensively to guide design choices. ‘Hash Pop’ is part of the  'Visual Poetry' group show curated by Atelier (http://atelierart.io). It’s an honor to be part of this exhibit. A special thanks goes out to Pixel Symphony and æther for putting it all together and also for their guidance and collaboration on this project.

Blue Lines,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/blue-lines,working,"""Blue Lines"" is an exploration of the interplay between order and chaos, utilizing the random walk algorithm.I was continuously engaged in drawing alongside creating Generative Art pieces. Gradually, I became interested in incorporating the concept of randomness generated by computers, which I experienced in the production of Generative Art, into my own drawings. The idea was to actively integrate randomness into the physical control of my drawing process. I use a blue pen (my favorite is the ZEBRA brand's marker ""マッキー極細"") and make time for drawing whenever possible. Sometimes, I even involve my pet cat in the drawing process, creating drawings through interactions with the cat. This ""Blue Lines"" is a work that simulates my computer-inspired drawings on the computer again. By using the computer-generated work as a base and adding more drawings to it, it becomes possible to co-create with both the computer and humans.Randomness is probably one of the keys to serendipity.Therefore, one way to use this piece is to print it out and have collectors add their own drawings to it. By layering hand-drawn elements onto the computer-generated base, ""Blue Lines"" becomes a canvas for collaboration, where human creativity and algorithmic randomness converge.1696 × 1200 px on Thumbnails5088 × 3600 px on Live View Modep5jsApril 1,2024hasaqui",Unknown

Neutrality of the rotten root,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/neutrality-of-the-rotten-root,working,"Neutrality can be problematic because, by avoiding taking a stance, one can ignore existing inequalities and injustices. This can lead to a false equivalence between unequal arguments and, consequently, distort the truth of the whole. Furthermore, neutrality can mask one's own prejudices and beliefs, preventing a complete and honest understanding of the facts. As an artist, I embrace neutrality in my abstract art to serve as a mirror for the viewer's own experiences and emotions. By maintaining a neutral stance, I invite a broader range of interpretations, making the art more accessible and personal to each individual who encounters it.

Budokan,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/budokan,working,"Budokan is a simple algorithm that can produce complex and nuanced outputs.Budokan is a battle between two different patterns with two different color palettes (one acting as a shader, the other as the base palette) mixed together in different ways. Additionally, each pattern/palette combination undergoes a color shift by one at evenly set intervals, which creates a tiled appearance, or when the patterns overlap, as determined by the style of each output.Palette colors are shifted either along the x-axis, y-axis or both the x/y-axis.The shaders are either simple black and white, or a gradient from black to white and may be mixed at different strengths (Shader Mix Power) with the base palette.The patterns, based on noise fields, are interpreted at different scales (tiny, small, medium, large, jumbo) which affects how granular the patterns that the noise field generates are.The artwork is fully responsive and scales to whatever size your gpu can handle. By default the browser window's height is used to inform the canvas height and the width is based off of one of three aspect ratios (1:1, 16:9, 3:4).Styles--------Contrast - The shader is a different pattern and mixed with the base palette.Harmony - The shader is the same pattern and mixed with the base palette.Overlay - The shader is a different pattern and is used to determine color shifts in the base palette. The shader palette is also mixed with the base palette.Alternating - The shader is the same pattern, and palettes alternate tiles.Shaders---------Gradient vs B & W/W & B - Gradient shading will have a more textured, painted look as opposed to the flatter look of the single color black and white palettes.W & B vs B & W - W & B shaders are heavier in whites.

Squiggle's Poems,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/squiggle's-poems,working,"Homage to the famed animator Chuck Jones and the MGM Animation/Visual Arts studio that adapted ""The Dot and the Line"" into a 10-minute animated short film for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, narrated by Robert Morley. ""The Dot and the Line"" won the 1965 Academy Award for Animated Short Film.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1ZdFUYxlsoTo refresh your memory here is a summary per (https://www.labocine.com/films/the-dot-and-the-line-a-romance-in-lower-mathematics)This is the anguished tale of a sensible straight line who falls in love with a dot. The dot, however, finding the line stiff, dull, and conventional, turns her affections toward a wild and unkempt squiggle. Though dejected, the line was not without determination, and, after much concentration, managed to bend himself, giving rise to shapes so complex he had to letter his sides and angles to keep his place. Before long he was able to express himself in any shape he wished, from helices to spider webs to Paul Klee's little jester. Overwhelmed by the line's geometric contortionistic prowess, the dot realized that what she had seen in the squiggle to be freedom and joy was nothing more than chaos and sloth. Thence, the line and the dot lived ""if not happily ever after, at least reasonably so."" The story ends with a punning moral: ""To the vector belong the spoils.""Through the power of Generative Art I'm giving Squiggle another chance.The spurned Squiggle has not given up on Dot. He has matured and developed a calligraphy. He uses it to create visual poetry hoping to catch Dot's attention and to rekindle lost love and win her back from Line.

Each artwork in the collection is composed of a series of basic modules, or 'monads', that are combined and transformed through an algorithmic process to generate a unique generative artwork.In philosophy, the term 'monad' was used by the German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz to describe the basic and indivisible unit of reality. In generative art, the term 'monad' refers to the simple elements that are combined and transformed through algorithmic processes to create artworks.Pioneers of generative art, such as Vera Molnar, Michael Noll, and John Whitney, experimented with the use of algorithms to generate artworks. These artists developed computer programs and mechanical systems that used simple patterns and shapes to create complex and dynamic artworks. In this context, 'monads' became the fundamental building blocks of these generative artworks.In the Monad 1960 Part Two collection, programming and algorithmic design are used to generate unique artworks that reflect the principles of the generative art movement. Each artwork in the collection is composed of a series of 'monads' that are combined and transformed through algorithmic processes to create a unique generative artwork, exploring the relationship between the simplicity of the 'monads' and the complexity of the resulting generative artworks.Features:This collection is created 100% with code, using only the JavaScript canvas. It has 8 color palettes available and over two thousand possible combinations for the algorithm to draw a unique piece.

BEHOLDER,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/beholder-1,working,"Description:Flowers, sunsets, temples, factories, grids, circuits, faces, shadows. What do you see?Method:BEHOLDER is an ode to entropy locking. A simple grid based system is used to draw ""circles"" and ""rectangles"" (hard to exactly call them that), using colors sampled from elsewhere in the grid, according to entropy-locked random rules. The size and shape of the grid, which colors and shapes to draw, and even how the colors will mutate, all is determined according to pure uniform random noise. The resulting emergent structure is a result of the entropy locking. Since entropy locking is unpredictable, there is also a check that regenerates the image if the generated frame color is pure white. This usually happens because the entropy lock simply never locked (it's random), resulting in a pure white output. If this happens, a super dumb trick is used to regenerate the image deterministically using the same hash but a different ""slice"" of the rng.BEHOLDER demonstrates the power of emergent behavior to create interesting patterns. With very limited code and rules, interesting visuals can be summoned from the void like magic. I setup BEHOLDER to mostly create ""bright moments"", little samples of shapes and colors that make me feel good to look at. Occasionally a stunningly clear shape or face arises, enjoy it if you see it, but know that others might not agree.Controls:s -> save a png of the outputn -> advance to the next frame... tap it over and over, see what happens, you'll get a feel for the algorithm",Unknown

This central motif is encased in a structural array of colorful, algorithmically-generated shapes that resemble petals or solar flares, each one a product of carefully tuned noise and randomness functions to achieve this organic yet orderly pattern. The backdrop is a grid-like structure that speaks to the underlying coordinate system, a fundamental element in computational graphics and design.The perimeter is defined by an explosion of fine, colored lines, each propelled by a set of parametric equations that govern their direction, length, and hue. These strings stand in stark contrast to the controlled serenity of the center, providing a visual representation of the generative algorithm's range—from the delicate balance of the core to the dynamic extremities.Press [S] to save a .png file in full view.D.__________________________________March 2024.",Unknown

Polako,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/polako,working,"""Polako"" means ""slowly"" in Montenegrin. When I first came here, the word I heard most often when I wanted to do something with someone or ask them for something was ""Polako."" In the culture I grew up in, everything happened very quickly and was results-oriented. In my new city, it's the opposite. Things may move slowly, requiring patience, but the aim is for better results. Perhaps they're right; the longevity of quickly done things is debatable. Our contemporary culture is like that too, everything is based on consumption. Art fields are also affected by this trend. Many artists or works without a past become popular with instant attention and then disappear after a while. This is sad in the long run. But when artists who don't get the recognition they deserve face these situations, they question themselves and their art, feeling inadequate and unsuccessful. As someone who has experienced this a lot, I am a keen observer. But speed is not necessary. What's important is to be lasting. Yes, this is very difficult. It's really hard to endure life and make your production sustainable. I must be patient. I need to mature my ideas. Slower, more polako. Surely, our art will be appreciated.

Unmanageable,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/unmanageable,working,"In ""Unmanageable,"" I undertake a profound journey into the heart of life's intricacies. This endeavor serves as my expressive outlet, where I reveal with a profound sense of awareness the truth I've discovered:Control is a mere illusion, revealing that ultimately, everything, when you get down to it, is… unmanageable.This insight was hard-earned, shaped by the trials of life, stretching across its wide and stormy expanse.I learned that every job is fundamentally about humans, about our interactions, emotions, and the unpredictabilities that come with them. It's a space where logic often gives way to the unmanageable nature of human relationships. Every expression of joy or frustration, every miscommunication, has offered me deep insights into the intricate web of human connection—complex and poignant in its reality.Finding a fulfilling romantic relationship is often attributed to luck. Yet, 'luck' scarcely encompasses the turbulent flow of connections and disconnections shaping our bonds. I count myself fortunate in love, yet this fortune comes intertwined with complex emotions, with moments of intense happiness shadowed by the fear of loss, creating a deeply emotional experience that touches the very core of my being.I've wrestled with the market – deciding on supply, price, and facing down the haunting shadow of imposter syndrome. It's a realm where unpredictability reigns supreme. I find myself in a constant comparison with others, better or worse, only to realize, in the end, it’s all unmanageable. This constant comparison, this relentless self-scrutiny, is a journey fraught with doubts and triumphs, each leaving their indelible mark on my soul, a story etched in every line of my work.Even money, especially in its digital, internet-driven form, eludes true grasp and understanding. It’s a nebulous world, where value shifts in the blink of an eye, often leaving more questions than answers, a reflection of the fleeting nature of what we hold valuable.And then there's time, ever fleeting, always escaping. It slips through my fingers like grains of sand, a poignant reminder of the ephemeral nature of our existence, of moments that pass before we can truly grasp them.Yet, there’s another layer to this unmanageable world – the way we consume and interact with content. People don’t read anything thoroughly anymore. E-mails, tweets, descriptions like this one, often go unnoticed in the whirlwind of information overload. We live in an era where content is devoured in short video form, fleeting and fast, leaving little room for the depth and contemplation that written words offer. This shift is indicative of the chaotic pace of our lives, where immediacy often overshadows depth, and the meditative quality of reading is drowned out by the constant barrage of visual media.In ""Unmanageable,"" I challenge this trend. By presenting my thoughts and experiences in a format that demands engagement beyond the superficial glance, I invite viewers to pause, to delve deeper than the ephemeral video clip.

Echoes of the 60s reverberate throughout the collection, infusing it with a sense of nostalgia. Drawing from the bold geometric shapes, psychedelic patterns, and vibrant color palettes that defined the era, Magma pays homage to the revolutionary spirit of the times while adding a contemporary twist.

When deciding what to wear, signals of identity, culture, place, time, values, memories, and so much more always trickle through. Spellbound embeds these personal signals in a scarf to keep you or a loved one warm.Using the fxhash params feature, you can record a voice note that will generate a unique scarf design. Record a message for a friend, your favorite song, or a quote you want to live by; get creative. After minting your token, you can redeem your scarf.Spellbound is the first fxhash project combining personalized on-demand fashion and generative art, pushing towards a more unique and sustainable future of fashion. Spellbound creates singular designs within a broader collection, resulting in cohesive aesthetics that allow individual expression while belonging to a tribe.The scarf is 190x30cm / 75x12inch and made of sustainable Merino wool in dark and lighter grey. Production and shipping costs are included in the token price. Minting of Spellbound tokens closes on the 1st of March, and redemption of your scarf is open until the 14th of March. Scarfs can only be redeemed once.Minting InstructionsThere are only two parameters to control here: a voice note and picking your scarf's design.Recording your voice note is done at the top of the token; these buttons will disappear after minting. The maximum length of your recording is 15 seconds, but you can stop recording beforehand. Once recorded, a scarf design will be generated. Some aspects of the design are relinquished to the gods of randomness. Therefore, you can pick from 5 different designs using the 'scarf design' parameter.You can't change the last four parameters; this is where the data of your voice note goes. If you randomize your parameters, random noise is the input. It is not recommended. Your wallet address is the seed for the random number generator; the design you see on the screen is what you get.Press ‘b’ to see the back of your scarf.Have fun!",Unknown

Metakinetic,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/metakinetic,working,"The concept behind ""Metakinetic"" is based on the idea of movement and metamorphosis. Each piece is created to be subsequently interpreted and traced by a plotter machine, reinforcing the evolving nature of the work. The choice of name reflects this intention: ""meta"" refers to the abstract representation of an articulated arm, which is then physically drawn by an actual articulated arm—the plotter. ""Kinetic"" refers to the element of movement inherent in both the artwork's theme and its method of production.This project also marks an important stage in my practice of plotter drawing. I made a conscious decision to develop works that could be plotted, ensuring that each creation could be adapted to different paper formats, from A4 to A1. The challenge was to ensure that proportions remained constant, regardless of the drawing's size, while using the same plotter tool.In other words, ""Metakinetic"" is an artistic exploration where form, function, and technical feasibility meet. The resulting pieces are both an expression of my personal aesthetic and a demonstration of the possible synergy between human creativity and mechanical precision.Plotter drawings are made with acrylic markers.

Realm Origins,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/realm-origins,working,"Welcome to the world of ""Realm Origins"" NFT card collection, imagine a realm where ancient beings and mythical warriors unite in a grand hierarchy, each card representing a unique character or artifact from this otherworldly universe.As you mint these collection cards, you embark on a journey to build your own personal army collection, with each card showcasing a unique identity. Your collection is a treasure trove of wonders waiting to be explored.*** IMPORTANT ***It is not just a SINGLE CARD, but rather a COLLECTION OF CARDS. You can check the collection size on the back view of the card. The collection can have a min of 9 cards and a max of 40841 cards in total. You can render or download each card from your collection.Each card has its own identity; you can consider it a personal card as well. A person has a name, title, rank, scores, gender, description, power, and a superior. I have also added a QR code.There is a rank system in place. The rank ranges from A to E, where A represents a high-rank card and E represents a low-rank card. The collection has a hierarchy system, which means all E cards would be under D cards, D cards under C cards, C cards under B cards, and so on.Ex: if there are 2 B cards and 10 C cards, the first B card could have 3 C cards under it, while the other B card could have 7 C cards under it.There is also a level system in place. There are two types of levels: count level and power level. The count level ranges from 1 to 5, where 1 represents a low number of cards and 5 represents a high number of cards. Similarly, the power level ranges from 1 to 12, where 1 represents a low-power card collection and 12 represents a high-power card collection.Ex: if the card's count level is 5, then the card collection size would be high. Similarly, if the card's power level is 12, the card in the collection would have more power. You can check the count level and power level in the console log.To determine card ranks and hierarchy, you can check the console for information on Card Rank, Under Cards, and Superior Name/Title. For instance, if a card has a Rank of D and 12 Under Cards, it indicates that there are 12 cards ranked below it. By analyzing this data, you can deduce the position of the current card in relation to others. Furthermore, observing the Superior Name can help in accurately identifying which specific card the current one is positioned under. To select a particular card, you have to add the &select=1,0,0,0,0 parameter in the URL. Now, what does the value ""1,0,0,0,0,0"" mean? In simple terms, it represents the location of the first card. You can understand it like this: ""1,0,0,0,0"" corresponds to ""A,B,C,D,E"". In this example, we are selecting the root card where all rank values are 0, and only the A rank card has a value of 1. Since there can only be one root card, we must use the number 1 for the A position.Default A Rank Card Location: &select=1,0,0,0,0Ex 1: &select=1,3,2,6,12, Here we will select E Rank CardA (1)└── B (3)....└── C (2)........└── D (6)............└── E (12)In this hierarchy tree:A Rank (Card 1) is at the top as the superior rank.B Rank (Card 3) is directly under A.C Rank (Card 2) is under B Rank (Card 3).D Rank (Card 6) is under C Rank (Card 2).E Rank (Card 12) is under D Rank (Card 6), representing the lowest rank.At this point we are selecting lowest rank card.Ex 2: &select=1,3,1,4,0, Here we will select D Rank CardA (1)└── B (3)....└── C (1)........└── D (4)............└── E (0) - There is not 0 cardIn this hierarchy tree:A Rank (Card 1) is at the top as the superior rank.B Rank (Card 3) is directly under A.C Rank (Card 1) is under B Rank (Card 3).D Rank (Card 4) is under C Rank (Card 1).Note: For download guide and more info, please consider console log in the browser.Important Note: The higher the total power of the collection, the more powerful it will be. The total power of the collection and individual card power will always be less than 1.Created by ArtLifeCreated using P5JS and QRIOUS (QR Code)Feb 2024",p5.js

Until biodiversity rains,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/until-biodiversity-rains,working,"Audiovisual generative artwork. In the interpretation of biological organisms, which break paradigms by doing something different, to adapt to changes and be able to survive, paths emerge to be imitated by so many, and make life flow. The development of the work is a metaphor for those paths full of ingenuity and risk, where colorful organisms in rows open trails, sliding like subtle drops, with sophisticated turns and elastic jumps.Some alternative paths usually hide a message along the way. Literally, one could find and read phrases in relation to biodiversity and its importance. Although it is more common to ignore them, sometimes not respect them, or what is worse, forget them. Even so, in an exacerbated insistence, here, audiovisual organizations seem to be repeating themselves, “until biodiversity rains”, and variety exploits so that ecosystems finally go it alone.Relationship between visuals and sounds:Biological organisms of different colors follow a path. They move forward, change shape, stop, turn. Always one after the other. At certain moments, they stretch and jump and sounds emerge.Towards the edges of the canvas, the jumps are translated into cello sounds, mainly pizzicatos. Towards the center, the piano.

Appearance and Being,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/appearance-and-being,working,"In 2021, I enrolled in a course about Genius, Inspiration, and Madness across ancient, European, and American traditions. A central theme of the course was a recurrent exploration of the Apollonian-Dionysian dichotomy described by Nietzsche in his seminal work ""The Birth of Tragedy"". Nietzsche contrasts the Apollonian (order, structure, rationality) with the Dionysian (chaos, emotion, primal nature) and suggests the interplay between these two drives is essential for creating profound art, reflecting the complexity of human nature. For me, this study extended beyond academic curiosity. It reshaped my perspective, elevating a concept I was superficially familiar with into a recurring theme I observed in my life or applied in my artistic pursuits.""Appearance and Being"" (Schein und Sein) aims to build upon the explorations of my previous works, ""Sol"" and ""Space & Ego,"" effectively serving as a third installment in an ongoing study. The series uses handpicked cellular automata rules at a close-up, through which I consciously navigate the space between strict structure and organic unpredictability. I start with a rudimentary, perfectly square form distorting it to the point of obtuseness. The ironically sharp edges of these obtuse elements, juxtaposed against a fading, concealed underlying structure, balance authenticity and aesthetics.All works are designed with plottability in mind, aiming to convey solids, stripes, and gradients through lines.Recommended pen tips for plotting are:Solid iterations: 0.4mm (size 04), but also works across a range of pens.Striped iterations: 0.4mm (size 04), but also works across a range of pens.Gradient iterations: 0.2mm (size 005), also works with smaller sizes. One rare color palette combination was inspired by a wonderful book I discovered at my local library - Edith Young's ""Color Scheme."" The book offers many different palettes across a diverse set of subjects. From these, I selected and merged two favorites to create a two-color palette - The Pupils of the eyes in Vermeer's portraits (1656-72) and The reds of the red caps in Renaissance portraits (1460-1535).  Implemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.Press p to save a PNG of the image in full screen.

META-color,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/meta-color,working,"This work is inspired by a monochromatic serigraph titled 'META from Bach' by Hungarian-born French Op Art artist Victor Vasarely. Created in 1965, it features a dynamic composition of alternating black and white squares arranged in a grid. The title reflects Vasarely's fascination with the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, particularly the concept of counterpoint, where multiple melodic lines interweave to create a rich tapestry of sound. The repetitive geometric patterns and precise lines in 'META from Bach' echo the interplay of voices within a fugue, visually translating the complexity and harmony of Bach's music.As a digital artist, I find myself deeply inspired by Vasarely's ability to evoke movement and depth through simple geometric forms. The underlying structures and patterns within his art serve as a constant source of inspiration for my own generative pieces. This reinterpretation of 'META from Bach' pays homage to Vasarely's brilliance by translating his counterpoint-inspired squares into a dynamic, algorithmic composition.

META-mono,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/meta-mono,working,"This work is inspired by a monochromatic serigraph titled 'META from Bach' by Hungarian-born French Op Art artist Victor Vasarely. Created in 1965, it features a dynamic composition of alternating black and white squares arranged in a grid. The title reflects Vasarely's fascination with the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, particularly the concept of counterpoint, where multiple melodic lines interweave to create a rich tapestry of sound. The repetitive geometric patterns and precise lines in 'META from Bach' echo the interplay of voices within a fugue, visually translating the complexity and harmony of Bach's music.As a digital artist, I find myself deeply inspired by Vasarely's ability to evoke movement and depth through simple geometric forms. The underlying structures and patterns within his art serve as a constant source of inspiration for my own generative pieces. This reinterpretation of 'META from Bach' pays homage to Vasarely's brilliance by translating his counterpoint-inspired squares into a dynamic, algorithmic composition. By introducing elements of randomness and interactivity, I aim to capture the spirit of Vasarely's composition in a new and contemporary medium.In keeping faithful to the OP Art genre this version is purely monochromatic. Please check out a companion effort (META-color) where I've added the dimension of color.Please visit my website www.drbillkolomyjec.com",Unknown

In The Round,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/in-the-round,working,"I have always believed that geometric shapes alone have capabilities that are often overlooked. With a few changes in the order, arrangement and color, you can create unique random designs in them. I always had ideas of space photos, planets and molecular changes in my mind, but I never came up with a specific idea. As long as the circles attract my attention, yes, these are the circles that can turn my mental challenges into reality. This design may not be scientifically correct, but it is not physics, mathematics or anything like that. These are my mental patterns that want to turn the contents of my imagination into artistic creations. I am not a seafarer or an astronaut, so I always stay away from complex scientific concepts because they make me move away from the wonderful space I have in my mind about the universe and my imaginations lose their beauty.

Wood Wooden,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/wood-wooden,working,"It was a sudden spark in my mind after losing a game of Jenga. When placed next to each other, the regular pieces of Jenga create interesting designs. But they were not perfect and there had to be changes to them. Thinking it was boring, I took the dog for a walk. Goldie's favorite shop was the animal toy shop. When I entered the store, seeing the toys of different animals, especially birds, and their coloring, as well as putting them together, the idea of arranging the pieces of Jenga was complete for me.I needed a wooden board with a classic arrangement and decoration in colors and shapes.Looking at the arrangements in the classic style, I tried to put pieces of wood with warm and vibrant colors and soft and tonal colors together in a frame.

Instead, everything we see in nature is shaped by processes where matter in different forms collides, exchanges energy, accumulates or disintegrates. Perpetual repetition of these natural processes weaves the beautiful complexity that surrounds us.Traditionally computers are seen as tools for working with ideal forms and exact mathematical representations, clean shapes and sharp angles. Even a random number generator running on a computer is a just a cheap trick to hide the underlying determinism.However, computers are also masters in repetition. They will blindly repeat a set of instructions for as many times as we want. And the repetition, shaping the initial state over and over again, creates the type of complexity we admire in nature.In this project, I have created a process, which repeats blindly by its own rules and adds layers and layers of marks on the canvas each new trace mixing with the existing ones. And the complexity in details that arises from the repetition starts to remind us about nature.-----Controls:- [a]: for full screen adaptive endless animation mode- [p]: for print mode (default, creates a printable image and stops)- [s]: Save PNG- [1] thru [6]: in print mode, change resolution multiplier (longer edge = 2000px times multiplier)With resolution multipliers 3 and up the preview animation is not drawn.Largest resolutions currently only work with Safari on a Mac and may take a very long time to generate.------ Requires WebGL2- Intended to be viewed on a Display-P3 compatible device and browser-----License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0Utilizes spectral.js library by Ronald van Wijnen (https://github.com/rvanwijnen/spectral.js) licensed under the MIT License.",Unknown

The mind, ever-restless, sought refuge in the margins of learning - a clandestine world where geometric oddities forming strange matter clusters came to life.Knowledge of the only basics of perspective rules and a few of the simplest geometric forms can’t stop the children’s creativity. Moreover, it encourages them to use and master it over and over again, transforming doodles into hyperbolically primitivistic worlds, where cubes and spheres become leading actors in endless stories.Palettes are simple and saturated, such as a box of pencils and pens. Layers of lines appear one by one, adding details to the previous drawing or changing its appearance completely, like a kid who decides to change the whole plot entirely in the middle of the story. The generative art medium acts as a true allegory of children’s endless creativity, making unique iterations one after another while there is a spot of ink in your pens.Made with love and p5js.The code of this artwork is dimension-agnostic.Controls in fullscreen:[1] - save PNG at the current resolution[2] - save PNG 8000  x  5332[3] - save PNG 12000 x  7998",p5.js

Spot the Moire´,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/spot-the-moire,working,"This artwork is a captivating interplay of precise algorithms and subtle randomness. Its foundation lies in a circle packing algorithm created by my collaborator, Chris Scussel. We begin by filling the canvas with two layers of these circles, generating intriguing interference patterns – the mesmerizing moiré you see here.Imagine peacock feathers with their mesmerizing eyes, translated into precise geometric forms. The artwork employs points from a large circle, meticulously mapped to corresponding points on a smaller one. Both circles have the same number of points, which are then connected by lines, creating captivating shapes. But there's a twist! A subtle phase shift between the circles disrupts the perfect alignment, resulting in the mesmerizing moiré patterns.Look closely, and you'll see an echo of a traditional plotter drawing technique - creating tones and values through meticulously placed lines. While black dominates, a splash of red appears randomly, 5% of the time, adding vibrancy and a counterpoint to the composition.And that's not all! A multitude of carefully chosen random variables ensure that every refresh of the artwork unveils a unique iteration, keeping you coming back for more. So, delve into this dance of lines and circles, and uncover the hidden order within the mesmerizing chaos.Enjoy!Please visit www.drbillkolomyjec.com",Unknown

Refresh to PLAY more.This mesmerising and pleasing art is based on a 1984 generative work by Geoff Davis of Micro (computer) Arts Group. It builds an image with layers, almost like a traditional painter applying paint to a canvas, which is then processed. The animation has speed control, including pause, and color controls which can be applied as the work is being created, and after it has been minted. This means one NFT defining the color and shapes, can create a huge range of art images. Even dark spooky images appear from the cheery hues of the innocent. Videos of this are on the microartsgroup website, or OPEN then PLAY here.Variations will show art of 7 different spectra and 1 full colour. The colors overlay in patterns so there are few pure hues. Color is a human psychological effect.The pale hues at the beginning are a colour field to rest your eyes, to “cleanse the palate”, before mellow soothing shapes appear. Yellow, often linked to the brightness of sunshine and the beauty of flowers, carries these positive associations even when in its pastel form. In the realm of color psychology, yellow is believed to be an invigorating hue that fosters a sense of optimism.Stare at the art and use a slow pace to relax.

Naiadic Variations,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/naiadic-variations,working,"Naiads are water nymphs, creatures from Greek mythology that hang out around small bodies of fresh water. They are typically depicted in human form but I like to think they're more watery; more fluid and flowing and formless. I came across some recently while making some work with fountains...## The ContextIn late 2023 I realised a project I’d been carrying around in my head for many years… I love the stubby, frothy fountains that bubble along the edge of the Barbican lake in the city of London. I love to watch the water rise and fall in infinite ever-morphing variations.I created two pieces of work capturing these fountains. One is pure video, the other is a digital collage of photos animated with a shader. You can view excerpts of them both here (https://vimeo.com/elwynco/slow-water) and here (https://vimeo.com/elwynco/still-water) respectively.After making these pieces, I was inspired to go a step further and try and recreate the entire phenomena out of code. What came out was more creaturely than I expected. The naiads in the fountains had clearly found a way to manifest themselves through my vulnerable human mind. (I assume the technology of lens and sensor were too harsh to tease out their shy souls.)## The PieceTo create this algorithmic work, I began with a simple geometric composition which abstracted the form of those Barbican fountains.This image was then passed to a single GLSL shader that would manipulate the pixels with a variety of noises and distortions. The primary effect is achieved by interpreting the base image into black and white versions, which then wind and warp around each other in near-infinite unpredictable ways. These are the naiads.In some rare variations we see them as reflections of each other on either side the canvas. In even rarer modes, their energy levels are extra high and their watery swirls dance in wide erratic loops.Whatever form they take, they come in a variety of dampness-inpspired hues (7 to be precise).## Generate a large printable versionThe standard animated version can only render up to about 5000px wide because of browser limitations. However, if you want a very hi-res version for print you can use print mode. Print mode disables the animation function animate.To use print mode add this to the url: `?print=true&width=12000` (where 12000 is the width you desire in pixels). It's recommended to use a Chromium browser (Chrome, Brave, Edge, Arc) for this.Once the image is ready, press [s] on your keyboard to save as a PNG.When watching the live version you can press [spacebar] at any time to play/pause the animation. When you pause the animation a `frame=xxxx` parameter will be added to the url. You can use this to print a specific frame.To do this, just add the frame value to the url like this: `?print=true&width=12000&frame=1234` (where 1234 is the frame number you want to print).## Gallery ModeWhen in live mode press [g] on your keyboard to enter gallery mode. This will create some padding around the canvas and the edge of the browser, add a subtle drop shadow and round the edges a little. Use this mode as an improved way of displaying the work on a standalone screen.## Further readingFor a broader description of the project go to: https://generative.elwyn.co/collections/naiadic-variationsTested in all major browsers on Apple silicon and on windows PC with an Intel chip.",p5.js

Pain,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/pain,working,"In the artwork, black and red intertwine, with lines connecting to dots. They rapidly come together and just as quickly disperse, creating an endless cycle, much like the ever-changing and persisting forms of pain. Whenever a mouse cursor glides across, these points and lines are instantly drawn in, only to repel each other in the next moment, mirroring the constant shifting of pain on the body. This piece is not only a display of dynamic visual beauty, but also a profound exploration of the complexity of pain. It invites the viewers into an ever-changing abstract world, to experience the approach and retreat of pain, its revelation and concealment, thereby provoking deep reflections on bodily sensations and emotional experiences.畫面中，黑與紅交織，線與點相連。它們迅速地聚合，又迅速地分散，像是無休止的循環，猶如痛的形式不斷的改變、延續。每當滑鼠滑過，這些點與線會立刻被吸引，卻又在一瞬間相互排斥，就如同痛在身上不斷游移。這件作品不僅是展現動態的視覺美感，更是對痛感複雜性的深刻探討。它邀請觀者進入一個不停變換的抽象世界，感受痛的接近與疏離，顯露與隱藏，從而引發觀者對於身體感知和情感體驗的深刻反思。",The library mentioned in the text is: Hydra

Este concepto evoca corredores reales, pasillos entre habitaciones, como los corredores de nuestra mente, por donde deambulamos e incluso nos perdemos.Los corredores de luces y sombras por donde deambuló Roy Batty, sabiendo que le quedaba poco tiempo de existencia, son una metáfora de nuestra vida. Un trazo apenas visible entre todo lo no explorado que pudo ser. Una habitación a oscuras parcialmente iluminada por la luz que viene del exterior. Trazos, luces y sombras, reales o imaginarias, creadas por nuestras angustias, dan forma y/o distorcionan la escena, haciendo manifiesto que lo importante no es solo lo que se ve, sino también lo que permanece oculto.'Todos estos momentos se perderán como lágrimas en la lluvia', dijo Roy Batty.Si esta frase improvisada por Rutger Hauer nos llega tan profundo, es probablemente porque todos, en mayor o menor medida, hemos deambulado por esos corredores. Aunque desconocemos el momento exacto de nuestro final, su inevitable aproximación es la única certeza. No podemos huir de esta realidad, ni siquiera al buscar en nuestros recuerdos, donde no encontramos ese momento anhelado al que quisiéramos volver. Esto nos confronta con el devastador sinsentido, lo que queda no será distinto de lo que ya hemos vivido; no habrá un lugar mejor. Lo que forma una contradicción con la esperanza y la curiosidad por descubrir qué nos depara el futuro.The title 'Roy Batty’s corridors' refers to Roy Batty, the replicant from the movie 'Blade Runner', and transitively to Ridley Scott and his use of light in his films. This concept evokes real corridors, hallways between rooms, like the corridors of our mind, where we wander and even get lost.The corridors of lights and shadows through which Roy Batty wandered, aware that his time of existence was running short, are a metaphor for our life. A brushstroke barely visible among everything unexplored that could have been. A room dimly lit by the light coming from outside. Strokes, lights, and shadows, real or imaginary, created by our anxieties, shape and/or distort the scene, making it clear that what matters is not only what is seen but also what remains hidden.'All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in the rain,' said Roy Batty.If this line improvised by Rutger Hauer touches us so deeply, it's probably because all of us, to a greater or lesser extent, have wandered through those corridors. Although we do not know the exact moment of our end, its inevitable approach is the only certainty. We cannot escape this reality, not even by searching in our memories, where we fail to find that longed-for moment to which we wish to return. This confronts us with the devastating nonsense, what remains will not be different from what we have already lived; there will be no better place.

Stamps of the digital skin,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/stamps-of-the-digital-skin,working,"“Stamps of the digital skin” is the result of a research process around tokenization technologies and generative art, this project was carried out within the framework of the Crypto Residency-Blockchain Fieldwork program, organized by Taipei Treasure Hill Artist Village.The project started from the idea of imagining the web 3.0 as a digital skin shared by all internet users, a collective skin on which we have begun to ""stamp"" a new visual imaginary. In this sense, what is proposed through this project is to open questions about the meaning we want to give to this new skin, that is, to collectively imagine the future of the web 3.0.It is worth mentioning that this project was developed in relation to ""Generative Taipei On-Site"", an exhibition project by VolumDAO that explores from different perspectives the overlaps or limits between object art, digital art and art generated by blockchain. “Stamps of the digital skin” is in dialogue with the section called ""Interpretation"", in which Yi-Wen and Nineteen propose an interesting relationship between generative art and Miao embroideries, object pieces that belong to a period of non-digital history.Thus, “Stamps of the digital skin” explores the limits of the relationships that can exist between pre-Columbian art from Latin America, generative art and blockchain technologies; it is a way of reinterpreting the ""ways of making"" of the past based on the imaginaries that digital technologies can offer us today.To put this idea into practice, the pre-Columbian seal was taken as a motif for reflection, which, similar to Miao embroidery, is made up of patterns and rules.Pre-Columbian seals are cylindrical ceramic objects that were made in abundance by the natives of the Latin American continent before the period of colonization. The use to which these objects were put is still unknown, as much of the indigenous memory of Latin America was lost during the process of colonization.It is also not known what materials these designs were stamped on, but it is believed that they were used to stamp symbols on the body.The Brazilian artist Anita Ekma proposes through performative practices to recover the technology of pre-Columbian stamps, this artist considers the hands painted and stamped with ochre on stones and caves all over the world as a symbolic milestone of the emergence of performance, body painting and the act of stamping.Thus, if pre-Columbian stamps were used to stamp symbols on the body, the present project proposes to stamp a reinterpretation of these symbols on the digital skin we share today, the web 3.0. The aim of this approach was to trace a reflection on the possible relationships between these objects, whose meaning or sense has been lost or erased, and the blockchain and web 3.0 technologies that formulate the creation of a shared interplanetary file system, which could preserve our collective memory online and without it ceasing to be ours. The idea is to emphasize the meanings, relations or questions that may arise between rituals related to the image and the body, as in the case of the stamping of symbols on the skin, and contemporary habits related to the image and our ""digital bodies"", that is, the processes of tokenization of images in web 3.0.In practice, the project consisted of reviewing and selecting recurring patterns and shapes on pre-Columbian stamps, creating generative stamping processes using the Javascript programming language, and finally uploading them to web 3.0 as NFTs._____________________[Key Controls]S - Download Image[URL Parameters]scale - Set the pixel density.",Unknown

Luminous Murmurs,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/luminous-murmurs,working,"** Story **In the heart of a silhouette world, where the taiga stretched its inky fingers toward the heavens, there lay a glade enshrouded in mystery. The forest, a stark contrast of darkness and light, watched over by a sky filled with the stillness of the Arura—a tapestry of colors so vivid they seemed to hold the very breath of the cosmos within their hues.There, amidst the sentinel trees whose bark shimmered with an inner luminescence, the glade pulsed with a life of its own. It was said that at the core of this glimmering woodland, the trees held the secrets of all who tread their roots. Incandescent filaments traced the intricate veins of leaves, and the undergrowth basked in the soft glow, casting long, ethereal shadows.By night, this place was transformed into a silent haven for the stars that pierced the dark canopy, their twinkle reflecting off the glistening leaves and bark, creating a dance of light in the absence of motion. The stillness was absolute, undisturbed by breeze or creature, as if time itself had paused to admire its own creation.Within this motionless sky, every traveler who entered felt an indescribable peace. Storytellers of old whispered that the trees harbored the spirits of the forest, that the light which suffused their beings were fragments of ancient souls that kept watch over the land. It was a sanctuary where thoughts became clear like the mirrored stars above.Under the steady gaze of the bright sky, the shining trees stood as guardians to this enchanted plot. Here, the whispers did not need the sound of voice but were felt as a gentle thrumming through the soles of one's feet, an unsung melody hummed by the earth itself. These trees, alive with ethereal fire, needed no motion to tell their story—their luminescence was the narrative, an everlasting testament to the beauty of stillness in a world that never truly sleeps.** Save ****GIF**: Press **G** to save your animation as a .gif file.**JPG**: Press **S** to save the artwork within the frame as a .jpg file.**View Frame**: Press **V** to save the current view frame.",Unknown

This leads to abundant moonlight in the early evening, which in the past, before the invention of electricity, traditionally helped farmers and crews to harvest their summer crops under the light of a large, bright, moon. Hence, it is called the ""Harvest Moon""!The Harvest Moon may also be called a Corn Moon, Barley Moon, or Wine Moon, or the Singing Moon or Elk Call Moon (we can get behind this name!).

Vulwarms,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/vulwarms-1,working,"FxHash genesis project by Vestica that explores the connection between technology and sexuality.Developed by translating an auto erotic act into a visual experience using the data gathered from testing sessions of the Smart vibrator device. Each visual shape represents a portion of 15 seconds per each session and is self-generated by reading data such as body temperature, device pressure and position through time.For ex., the colour is generated using force (gF) and temperature (C) values. As these values increase over time, the hue and saturation of the colour also increase. As shape moves inside the canvas grid simulating movement positions of the vibrator device in physical space, it creates a form that metaphorically resembles female genitalia.By materialising an intimate act, from binary system to the visual form, the work symbolically mimics a mechanism of scientific determination of highly abstract concepts, such as erotic pleasure, engaging with the concept of disciplining the body through these rationalisations.Options:Press [1-5] to change resolution.Press [s] to save the image.",Unknown

Country Spirit I,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/country-spirit-i,working,"“Raoul Pictor cherche son style…” (Raoul Pictor is looking for his style…) was launched in Saint-Gall, Switzerland, in 1993. It consists of a Mac LC computer, a 12-inch color screen, and an HP 500C printer.The program presents an animation in which we can observe an artist, Raoul Pictor, working in his studio. He paints, paces while deep in thought, consults books from his library, plays the piano, and enjoys red wine. The sequence of these activities is non-linear. The canvas is seen from behind, resting on the easel in the center of the room. We are unable to see what is being painted. Once his painting is complete, he picks it up and exits through a side door. It is at this moment that the printer springs into action, delivering his unique, dated, and signed work.This project has been exhibited in numerous exhibitions around the world. Subsequently, a Flash version, ""Raoul Pictor Web Studio,"" was developed to make it available on the internet (2001). In 2013, for its 20th anniversary, an iOS version, ""Raoul Pictor Mega Painter,"" was developed in collaboration with the great Matthieu Cherubini (mchrbn.net). In 2023, for its 30th anniversary, an update seemed necessary to continue the adventure on the fx(hash) platform – thank you for making all of this possible!

g-scapes,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/g-scapes,working,"Click for sound.My previous release, e-scapes, is a series of generative artificial intelligence artworks released on the EmProps platform that can be seen at: https://emprops.ai/projects/e-scapesWhile the e-scapes series was generated using the text to image technology of Stable Diffusion, this series explores similar themes, but instead is written in web technologies like JavaScript.I wanted to continue to use ai in the creation of this work, so I explored prompting ChatGPT to create code for this artwork.For example, in order to create the sound for this artwork, I used a prompt as follows:Write a thorough HTML Audio and javascript codebase with many classes and functions that can create a sound composition. The code should create a song that is capable of playing for an infinite length of time, and the sound should be constantly evolving and changing. The composition should include a variety of interesting sounds. The generative soundtracks should be well balanced, and include artistic and experimental sound. The HTML Audio and javascript codebase should be capable of generating a random never ending sound based composition every time the code is run, which is different from any other generation. So be sure to randomize all of the elements, such as timing, sounds, repetitions, gain, fading in and out, modulation, feedback, and other musical concepts to allow for maximum diversity of sound. Make sure not to use .mp3 files, and instead programmatically create the sounds using HTML Audio and javascript.Similar prompts were written to have ChatGPT create p5.js code for the visuals and animation.It would be wild to have ChatGPT return a 10,000 or a million line codebase, and while that seems technically possible, it is not allowed. Most code returned was around 100 lines, and it told me to finish creating the artwork myself.I took all of the snippets of code that ChatGPT provided, and incorporated it into one final codebase. I added some code to bring the randomization in alignment with what I felt would make for interesting generative art. I added code to be able to have control over the colors that were used, but for the most part, AI wrote this code, and a human was in the loop to provide some basic integration and mild creative input.This code took about five days to write, so AI has shown to be very fast in iterating on creative concepts, and producing high end code. Some of the great power of AI systems are in their ability to give you unexpected outputs, which in more serious systems can be very dangerous, so it is something to consider when using these technologies in systems where the fault tolerances are tighter.There are a couple notes on this project. First, the preview is intended to be a darker, less saturated, greyed out version of the running project. This artistic decision was made as a rejection that the preview is the most important part of the artwork. One of the advantages of digital art is that it is capable of movement and sound in a way that more traditional mediums are not. By clicking play on this artwork and experiencing it as intended, you will be rewarded with a vivid world of sound and color.A second note is that while the visuals are deterministic, the sound is not. While the animations were more liberally adjusted to allow for determinism, the code for the sound is pasted almost exactly as it was output from ChatGPT. It is more important to me to preserve the code that ChatGPT created, to provide an example of how AI can create sound. I have thought about enhancing this sound with a variety of other instruments, randomization, notes, musical concepts, but I felt that would take away from the importance of the work.Holders of my previous fxhash Tezos projects can contact me on my website with their Ethereum wallet, and I will add it to the reserves.Enjoy your life.Technologies used: HTML, HTML Audio, CSS, JavaScript, p5.js, ChatGPTThe software used to create this artwork is made available under the MIT license.

.empathy,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/.empathy,working,""".empathy"" is a generative art inspired by action painting.  Its purpose is to achieve harmony by adding actions through the color addition and mixing technique and overlaying curves with a certain regularity through mathematical formulas. Considering the influence of producing a different shape each time through hash, the criteria for aiming at average stability and harmony are likely to be significantly different.The number of repetitions and the color palette have a significant mutual influence, and even a slight variation led to significant differences in the final balance. In this case, considerations extend beyond simply managing the balance between overlapping and whitespace, and it's important to acknowledge the potential impact of metamerism resulting from additive color mixing.As a solution, the decision was made to first fix the number of repetitions, set 7 types of curves that match it, and adjust the color palette last.Color palettes includes palettes based on attempts to reproduce something, imaginations of emotions, and selections adjusted from randomly chosen options, among other methods. Although multiple approaches to creating palettes coexist, they are not explicitly disclosed. After over a month of careful selection, 13 types from A to M remained.Choosing continuously through random() and meditatively selecting to draw out the unconscious are similar yet different practices. However, I felt that the act of coloring the results chosen by random() could potentially approach unconsciousness.・Press keys 1 to 4 , adjust the resolution settings.・You can also save the image by pressing the ""S"" key.Generative art by @dotconatusBuilt in Javascript with p5.js.",p5.js

Seeing the pattern at a distance and with differing angles of light, shadow, and the inevitable loss of tiles over time reveals the subjective nature of standing and observing a piece of art. Each viewing is an experience of its own.This project is a reimagining of the experience of seeing such a tiling on the wall - one I enjoyed during my three months spent living in Sintra, Portugal during early 2023. Through changes of scale, probability based recursion, and palette, the initial tiling design on the wall in the station is evolved into a series of pixels and tilings across a larger composition. It reminds us that even in the most structured compositions, there is room for spontaneity and unpredictability. The palettes for this project are sampled from photos I took at Rio de Mouro and elsewhere in Portugal, as well from other photos taken on the way to my current home in Santiago, Chile.

Oneiric Places,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/oneiric-places,working,"Dreams can often be confusing.Particularly when we've just woken up and can only recall them in vague, fragmented pieces. As we try to remember what occurred during our slumber, we often struggle to form a clear, overall picture. Those scattered scenes not only cause confusion about our dreams themselves, but through consistent introspection, they gradually blend with our perception of reality.As I delved further into dream research and the associated neurological phenomena, I developed a deeper understanding of my own dreams. As a result, they took on a heightened sense of clarity and I occasionally have instances of lucid dreaming.These experiences have made it increasingly challenging for me to distinguish between dream memory and reality. Eventually, I reached a point where everything - the code, the outputs, my dreams, and my waking life - began to merge into one big, surreal mess.The creation of ""Oneiric Places"" helped me s̶o̵r̷t̸ ̶through this mess, and eventually it felt like a logical step to integrate my dream reports into the code in some way.

Polar,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/polar-1,working,"Polar [Radical Simplicity]In a constantly bustling world where complexity reigns supreme, ""Polar"" stands alone. This creation in p5.js defies conventions, firmly aligning itself with the lineage of minimalist art. Here, there are no frills, no artifice. Only the purity of form matters, the raw simplicity that emanates from every line and shade of gray. Each line, each curve is an expression of mathematical precision, devoid of any excess.The color palette is also stripped down to the essentials. Two opposing colors, white and black, clothe the stage. This duality creates a powerful contrast, a palpable visual tension. The choice to invert these colors or differentiate them adds a layer of complexity to this apparent simplicity, creating an unstable equilibrium.Where others might see a minimalist canvas, ""Polar"" reveals its subtle rebellion. It stands on the fringe of contemporary artistic conventions, choosing to distinguish itself by reducing everything to its core. Form, color, movement—everything is simplified to the extreme, but in this radical simplicity, it finds its true power.It's an invitation to look beyond appearances, to delve into the world of minimalism. ""Polar"" reminds us that beauty can emerge from simplicity, that the purest expression can be found in radical reduction. It's a challenge to complexity, a bold statement that reminds us that sometimes, the most impactful art is found in the most radical simplicity.## Press [s] to save the image## Generate a printable versionYou can render more detail by adding a `pixelDensity` parameter to the URL,  eg: `?pixelDensity=2`.

Béton Brut,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/beton-brut,working,"Béton Brut is a generative art series inspired by the raw aesthetics of brutalist architecture. It encapsulates the essence of brutalism – the celebration of raw materials, the interplay of light and shadow, and the daring embrace of geometry. This project explores my vision of concrete structures translated into abstract visual compositions. The choice of a grid format pays homage to the inherent modularity and order often found in brutalist architecture. The deliberate ambiguity of the outputs invites the viewer to find their own meaning within each piece. By doing so, the project creates a canvas for introspection, where the observer's own memories, emotions, and interpretations converge with the abstracted structures before them. For instance, given my background in computer science, I often find that certain outputs evoke associations with computer chips or complex circuitry, melting the boundaries between art, architecture and technology. In Béton Brut raw emotions meet calculated design. Remember that the reflections you see are not confined to the canvas, but spring from the depths of your own experiences.

The Thickness of Time,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/the-thickness-of-time,working,"Complex patterns stem from the overlay of simple shapes, and an extensive history arises from the interweaving of random events. Time, once gone, never returns, yet every moment leaves its mark on the wall. In this work, we delve into the significance of sedimentation—experiencing the accumulation and outcomes brought about by the occurrence, alteration, movement, and demise of individual events. Perhaps, it's these successive imprints of change, the alternating patterns of old and new, that truly define the depth of time itself.I have used animation to simulate the progression of things and the flow of time. In different stages of creation, various colors and styles dominate, yet no one can predict what the wall will look like in a few seconds. Each event, when it occurs, presents one aspect, but the subsequent strokes overlay to create a different impression. Hence, singling out the meaning of one event, disregarding all others, is precisely the most meaningless act. Perhaps the greatest impact time brings us is the change in our perception of reality. It's a complex series of interlinked, random changes: past events influencing the development of subsequent ones, while future events alter the presentation of past occurrences. We can neither retrieve the time that has passed nor completely isolate the present moment. We can only sense all the past 'sedimentation,' experience the 'thickness of time,' through the wall.This is a generation artwork made by pure code.In live mode, press 's' or 'S' to save a high resolution png.Please be patient with drawing process (it'll take about 1~2 minutes in my computer).Enjoy~EndlessworldDec, 2023",Unknown

Heat Death Infinity,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/heat-death-infinity,working,"This piece was started as a thing about evolution. I joined the generative art movement one year ago, so to celebrate it, I decided to take the code of the Tangentum and let it evolve into something new.I made several attempts, and all of them were unsuccessful. And the reason was not the code quality - it worked as it should, but the life ran out of it with every iteration. It looked rotten, like organic cells falling apart. At the same time, I was facing a period of existential crisis, so it took me even deeper into my dark emotions. My artwork was dying, like myself.But then I realized that it’s a natural process. You meet the Idea, or the Muse, and it helps you give birth to an artwork, probably with pain. Then It lives its life, with or without you, and then it dies. You can do nothing with it, the only thing you can do is accept it. You can’t reuse the same idea to make art over and over again; someday, you have to let it go and give something new a chance.So I finished this piece as a thing about acceptance of death, at least the death of Muses and Ideas.Please use fullscreen or download artwork in high resolution for a better viewing experience.

Ratio,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/ratio,working,"[This project has audio, click on the live view to start.]Night Sea presents Ratio, a generative audiovisual piece examining the underlying acoustics of tuning systems. By considering the relationship between sound frequencies rather than musical notes, the piece explores the possibilities of harmony without the constraints of an instrument. Utilizing specific intervals which the human ear perceives as balanced, the algorithm creates a chord by computing a set of frequencies which are multiples or subdivisions of the interval. Combining this algorithm with the hash, Ratio produces a unique chord for each mint, with varying levels of tension, brightness, and microtonal deviation. The sound field washes up against visuals which evoke streams of light falling across a series of panes. Sound data slowly illuminates and transforms the panes over time, creating a meditative respite for viewers.

Long Form Blots,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/long-form-blots,working,"Artists Brief:The intention behind LFB is to create a Long-form Gen-Art project that's uncomplicated for the viewer, a project that could be used as an example to explain to someone who doesn’t understand the long-form Gen-Art process.A topic that from the inside out is an incredibly intricate and reasonably complicated journey for the artist, let alone takes a more advanced level of knowledge to explain to someone used to navigating traditional Art.By creating a project where the Art can be appreciated for being Art for Art's sake alone, in my mind it's the mechanics beneath the ‘Generative’ work that gives the Art power. Having Artwork that is easier to read on the surface means it's far more manageable when you begin to explain how the Artwork actually came to fruition.That's why before starting the creative process I made sure to set out some rules to follow from the off-set.It was important for me that the collector (viewer) can visually connect with each iteration, this is made possible through the first rule I applied - Use ‘Simple Geometry’. Simple Geometry is something we become familiar with from a very young age. We identify with shapes such as the; Triangle, Circle, or Square.  I wanted to create an algorithm that would take each of these elements and manipulate them into interesting and aesthetically pleasing outcomes. But the core of each iteration starts with one or two or a mixture of these three simple shapes. They are the core elements used in each final generated outcome, as it is these shapes that the viewer will instantly resonate with just as they have done from infancy.Enjoy.

The collection borrows its name from a 1919 short-story cycle by Sherwood Anderson, which explores a peculiar cast of characters living within a fictionalized, midwestern town. Like Anderson’s text, the “Winesburg, Ohio” algorithm constructs a world through recurring portrayals of specific structures and landmarks. Its scenes are populated by a variety of familiar elements taken from my larger body of work, including water towers, houses, and churches. Meanwhile, a series of scripted gestures insert abstract compositional elements into the outputs, counteracting their pictorial legibility.

Komšije,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/komsije,working,"Komšije,' a word meaning 'neighbors' in Serbian, is an art piece that intertwines architectural elements with the Golden Ratio (1:1.618). Inspired by the brutalist architecture of New Belgrade, Serbia, and my love for minimalism and modernism, this work explores the possibilities of this combination generatively.The buildings of New Belgrade, a significant inspiration for this piece, exhibit a unique character. Despite their aesthetic, which may have fallen out of popular style, these structures are exceptionally solid and well-designed, having withstood the test of time. More than mere apartment blocks, they represent vertical ecosystems. Within their stark and imposing concrete forms exist a multitude of private worlds, each suspended in a communal yet distinct space, embodying the essence of interconnectedness and resilience.The Golden Ratio, a recurring element in my creations, is a proportion frequently found in nature. It is visible in sea shell spirals and human body proportions, offering an aesthetically pleasing and comforting familiarity.In 'Komšije,' this ratio arranges mostly residential architectural forms in elevation view, blending Mid-Century modernism, Japanese post-modernism, and Eastern European brutalism. The compositions are created by repeatedly dividing the width and height of each piece by the Golden Ratio, ensuring every element is proportionally related to the whole. This method aligns column widths and floor heights, maintaining a cohesive structure.The artwork strikes a balance between formal architectural diagrams and hand-drawn sketches. It features generative imperfections that mimic my sketching style, fostering a sense of openness and possibility missing from formal or detailed diagrams and renders. Although the structures depicted may not be architecturally practical, they are designed to evoke a sense of wonder and joy through their playful geometry and massing.—————TENDER x Studio YorktownDecember 2023'Komšije’ is Serbian for ‘neighbors’, and is a generative art series created by Studio Yorktown in collaboration with Adam Berninger of Tender.—————Key Commands : Press ‘S’ to save a high-resolution output of your structure.",p5js

These elements form reaction fields, colonies, flocks, oceans, rivers, forests, mountains, clouds, earth, and stars and galaxies scattered throughout the universe. They exist in countless numbers at each scale, and their interactions cannot be ignored. Chemical, physical, and biological interactions occur, resulting in complex phenomena. These phenomena are stirred, collided, reacted, collapsed, extinguished, and multiplied by flows.Similarly, in the social and mental constructs humans create, such as cities, organizations, societal and economic networks, information on the internet, cultural values, languages, thoughts, and emotions, there exists a similar interplay, leading to complex dynamics.Fluctuations exist on all scales.Even seemingly stable phenomena are constantly fluctuating and in flux when viewed on different scales of time or space, and there is no such thing as an unchanging situation. Each element is as small as a grain of sand when viewed as a whole, and no single element alone affects the whole, but is swallowed up by the larger current and fleetingly disappears with a momentary emission of color.I feel that the lifespan of an individual is also like this.Subtle alterations and flows are interwoven into everything around us, possessing an unpredictably influential nature.

After seeing the visuals he sent back, I got the direction of the sound. I added sounds which reminded me of wind.Sometimes I feel something between the two winds. It comes and goes. It comes. And goes.Naoyuki Takeda————————It has been almost 20 years since I have collaborated with Naoyuki Takeda, who is active as a trackmaker in a wide range of genres from J-pop to deep house to ambient. We used to make music together, and it is a great pleasure to be able to work together again through Gen Art.This work plays an mp3 file of approximately 12 megabytes and changes the Gen Art accordingly. It was a challenge to create a work using such a relatively heavy file. That seems to be possible with fxhash!The Gen Art overlays geometric curveVertex figures that form a circle, and rotates them as they change.I added changes that seem to sway in the wind, and aimed to create an animation that can be watched all the time with music.My previous collaboration with Gen Art and music was ""Async to Sync"", a project by KUMALEON, and this work is based on the experience and codes from that project.

The repetition of textures and their layering creates effects that reveal the beauty of randomness. The structure formed by the consecutive repetitions and layering effects highlights the beauty of randomness. Random and repeated animations are based on patterns that are erased and recreated each time. The movement that pauses within the flow and then erases and recreates each texture results in a unique animation. I feel that I have defined myself as an artist in this field now. I sense that I've reached a correct point stylistically.

Thought & Change,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/thought-and-change,working,"Thought & Change is my first published generative art project, created using p5.js.It is an exploration in using simple shapes - rounded rectangles - to create abstract and ever-shifting compositions which represent thoughts and how they change over time. Parameters such as the width, height, corner radius, position, and colour change every few seconds, just as thoughts shift and morph as we encounter new experiences and ideas. However, there are always bounds to how much any given thought can change - these limits are determined at conception and never change over the duration of the piece. I have gone through a dramatic shift in my mentality towards work and life over the past couple months and wanted to create something simple but mesmerizing to commemorate that experience.Unique Features of your Generative Token:- Colour palette used by the collection of thoughts (ratio of width:height of each thought is used to determine the colour from the palette)- Opacity of the collection of thoughts- Lower and upper bounds for the width and height of each thought- Lower and upper bounds for the position of each thought in the frameControls:- p: Play/Pause the animation. Stops or resumes at the next change (you may need to wait a moment)- s: Save as a PNG at the current display size.Values & Reasoning:In Cantonese culture, certain numbers are associated with specific meanings or considered special due to their pronunciation.- 36 thoughts in every composition. 36 = 6^2. 6 sounds like the word for ""flow"" or ""smooth""- 256 iterations. 256 = 2^8. 8 is considered very lucky because it sounds like the word for ""wealth"" or ""prosperity""- 3 Tez price. While not as special as other numbers, 3 sounds like the word for ""life"" or ""birth"".

Harmonious Hill,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/harmonious-hill,working,"Step into the vibrant world of FXHash 2, where art meets innovation! This piece of art is a tribute to the launch, inviting you to immerse yourself in its dynamic visuals.Once upon a time, in the realm of the lines, there rested a world overlooked by the atmospheric views of hills, christened as Harmonious Hill. A world, where the sun, the moon, and the stars were born out of infinite circles effortlessly looping. A world that was bathed utterly in monochrome hues of the cosmic palette.It was once teeming with life, laughter, and colors before the great apocalypse. A disaster so colossal, that it wiped out all color, replacing it with an eternal melancholy of black and white.The Harmonious Hill, though stripped of its vibrancy, stood resiliently against time. The skies were filled with perpetual fog, a reminder of the long-lost days. The vertical and curvy hills, once gliding into vibrant valleys, now housed derelict and deserted towns.The Taiga trees, bound by the monochrome, delineated themselves as large silhouettes against the never-ending horizontal line of the sky, whispering tales of the catastrophic past to the lonely artists. The haunting echoes of the past continued to reverberate, ironically absorbed by these mute trees.Amid the somber monotones, the lone survivors were the birds. Soaring across the gloomy apartment buildings, their elegiac songs spun tales of lost epochs in the cold air, threading through the silent trees and melancholy fog.One day, a new phenomenon graced the hills. The everyday circle loop of the sun enlarged, as though trying to consume the sullen world. Fear encapsulated the folks of the Harmonious Hill as they watched the sun spiral, assuming it to be the second apocalypse in line.In the foreboding silence, a tiny speck of white emerged from the enormous sun, descending to the sky. As it journeyed closer, the birds serenaded its descent. It was a seed, glowing white and vibrant against the black skies.Upon reaching the cold ground, it burrowed into the heart of Harmonious Hill. Silence fell once more; the sun receded to its normal loop. Days turned into nights, and nights into days.Then, in the stillness of a frosty dawn, the seed burst forth from the ice-cold soil. A majestic tree, unlike any Taiga trees, flourished. It sprouted not just leaves, but colors. Colors of hope, resilience, and rejuvenation. It shone vibrantly, piercing through the eternal fog.The birds sang, and their melodies turned from dirges to ditties of joy. The people in the houses awoken from their centuries-old slumber, stepping out for the first time into the fresh, thawing world. As they saw the growing tree of colors, they weaved stories of a new beginning, a world reborn.In the realm of lines and monochromes, the world of Harmonious Hill thus welcomed hope, banishing its perpetual sadness into a tale of survival and rebirth. The apocalypse became a fable of transcendence, of how desolate lives could burgeon anew, in the miraculous world of art.To navigate and interact with the artwork, here are the key controls:S Key: Press 'S' to save the image content of the current frame.

MILK. by Gertrude Stein,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/milk.-by-gertrude-stein,working,"This new special edition of Poems in the Public Domain was created for Tezos @ South Beach 2023 and in celebration of fxhash 2.0. Expanding on the original project, MILK. lets collectors personalize their iterations by including their own annotations at mint time. An acknowledgement of the deeply personal nature of reading, these annotations will also be used to create a separate “communally annotated” version of the piece, to be distributed to holders once the exhibition closes. In composing your annotations, we encourage creativity, implore respect, and recommend minimal use of special characters.When a poem enters the public domain, it no longer belongs to its author but to its readers, who help ensure others will read it. By minting a copy of MILK., you are participating in a uniquely modern form of this ageless cycle. Readers, like you, write poetry’s survival. **See the original project here: www.fxhash.xyz/generative/20750And read about it here: www.fxhash.xyz/article/poems-in-the-public-domain-marginalia-as-living-verseMinting InstructionsEach annotation can be a maximum of 64 characters. In our experience, the most successful comments are about half of that.You are required to provide something for the first annotation. The second is optional. The following codes can help ensure your annotations lay out nicely:+  =  line break (example: i want this to appear + as two separate lines)<  =  place comment only in left margin (example: <this comment would make no sense in the right margin) >  =  place comment only in right margin (example: >this comment would make no sense in the left margin) Happy annotating!",p5.js

Alien's game,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/alien's-game,working,"We met a couple of weeks ago in the park. It was just an evening walk. Suddenly, it started raining, and the only place I could hide from it was a big tree with a cozy bench underneath it. At first glance, the most ordinary middle-aged man was already sitting on the bench. He was immersed in some papers and had been sitting there for a long time. The rain was getting heavier, but the tree covered us reliably. I decided to look closer at my occasional neighbor. I won't describe how he was dressed; everything looked ordinary and usual, but I subconsciously felt some oddities and inconsistencies. For example, his shorts had no pockets. Have you ever seen men's shorts without pockets? The shoes and shirt were not just matched; they were precisely the same color. It was small but made it feel like an overly precise imitation.As I said, he was holding and reading some papers; it was something like a brochure, but the sheets were connected in a slightly different, unusual way. ""Reading"" is not the right word either, because there was no text in the ""brochure,"" only some pictures. He noticed my attention, and I looked at his papers; he was not surprised at all, and seeing a question in my eyes, he said that these were records of the game and he was analyzing the games played. When asked about the game name, he said that I had probably never heard of it and the name would not tell me anything. After a short conversation, he kindly showed me the game recordings. I tried to find the game's name on the Internet by its appearance, but I could not find such a game, although there was something slightly similar. This seemed strange to me, as did the fact that the playing field size in his recordings was different. All the fields were square, but the sizes varied. There were tiny fields and larger fields. The piece's arrangement in the corners was also unusual. Nevertheless, the positions had some systematicity, which was only sometimes obvious.I like strategy games like chess, checkers, or Go (this game seemed strategic to me), so I was interested in the unusual game and asked him to let me take a picture of a couple of game sheets to try and figure it out later. Still, the stranger shoved the whole booklet at me, saying he had more. Then he noticed the rain was over, apologized, saying he was in a big hurry, and quickly left. I was unprepared for his quick leave, and by the time I came to my senses, he was gone. After the parting, I thought a lot about the game, about the odd stranger, and started calling him ""alien"" for myself. I present him strictly under this ""name""; I hope he will excuse me.Why don't I share notes for free but want to get paid for mint? Free stuff attracts much less attention, and the fee for 1 mint is relatively small. I hope you enjoy owning the recordings of a unique game. If I ever meet him again, we will decide together what to do with the money.Hopefully, our next meeting will happen someday, and I can learn more about him, the game, and where they are from. If I have any new information, I'll update you on that.Press 2-5 for higher pixel density, and 's' to save a png.",Unknown

Each instance, ephemeral and elusive, is a fleeting visitor in the vast expanse of time, leaving behind a mosaic of recollections. These transient moments, though fleeting, chart our course through the labyrinth of life, tinting our perspectives and encounters.In the societal sphere, this notion echoes the swift currents of transformation. Concepts, paradigms, and standards undulate and morph, often vanishing before we can fully comprehend their resonance. This perpetual metamorphosis mirrors the vibrant dynamism of human civilizations, where the only permanence is change itself.This spectacle, manifest in both life and society, embodies the quintessence of transiency and the allure of ephemerality.

The Doors' album 'Waiting for the Sun', a cherished disc I hadn't spun in ages, began to spread its psychedelic aura throughout my studio.Each crackle of the vinyl was a reminder of the golden years, each melody a journey through time. Morrison's voice, more alive than ever, wove its way through the veil of the past, transporting me back to an era where music and poetry merged to capture the zeitgeist.In this suspended moment, 'Harmonic Chaos' was born. Carried by the waves of 'Love Street' and 'Spanish Caravan', my keyboard became the instrument of my reminiscence. The lines of code started to dance with the music, and as if by magic, the iterations began to emerge, capturing the soul of a bygone era in a series of images where minimalism meets abstraction.The poem, a creation by ChatGPT immersed in the spirit of Morrison, echoes that evening when music transformed inspiration into visual art.

Luminous Echos,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/luminous-echos,working,"Luminous Echos is an open edition to celebrate the launch of fxhash 2.0 and will remain open until leap day 2024. With a free physical edition randomly given away for each batch of 100 mints. Iterations are redeemable for a signed physical edition.All outputs contain embedded blueprints for cutting a physical edition with a high powered laser out of 12 layers of archival paperboard. —————-In a realm where the very essence of creation is bound to chaos, there lies a series of masterworks, a testament to the harmonious blend of order and chaos. Each piece, a confluence of geometric precision and the untamed spirit of the shadow and light, invites the onlooker to traverse the boundaries of the physical and the ethereal.The art, attracted to the strong emotions and vibrant events of the world, materializes in a cascade of circular motifs—each a pocket of infinity, reminiscent of echoes, ancient and brimming with latent potential. The lines flow like streams of sunlight, bending and twisting in a dance choreographed by the rhythms of the universe, defying the rigid confines of two-dimensional space.Here, in these manifestations of creativity, one might sense the influence of imagination, where thoughts and ideas cast a physical form. The colors are whispers of the cognitive realm, vibrant yet bounded by the monochrome discipline of the physical realm, creating a duality that reflects the very nature of all beings—part of two worlds, yet fully belonging to neither.The artist, a lightweaver of sorts, has woven a pattern of lies so majestic that they reveal a deeper truth—the truth of beauty inherent in the mathematics of the universe, the geometry of existence, and the profound complexity hidden within the seemingly simple.This generative series, thus named “Luminous Echos,” for it is a bridge between the seen and unseen, a crafted illusion that binds the soul of the observer to the eternal dance of creation and cognition—a masterful rendition regarded with a mesmerizing ""Mmmmmmm.""",p5.js

Stargazing,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/stargazing,working,"I was fortunate to grow up in a place with very little light pollution. The night sky filled with countless stars, the star formations, the slow movement over weeks and months and the occasional shooting star, became a constant source of fascination and admiration. If you have seen the Milky Way as a thick white band of millions of stars going from one end of the sky to the other, you know what I'm talking about.Moving to the city to study and work largely came in the way of this fascination for many years. I did however pick up some astronomy classes at university to learn more about how everything works in outer space. The planet and star types, the supernovas, the foggy star nurseries and everything in between. Stargazing and admiring space events was still a favorite activity, but getting away from the light sources was tricky.Fast forward a number of years, the pandemic hits. Out of the chaos and fear, a new world of remote work opportunities for software engineers appears. Moving more rural meant it was once again possible to admire the night sky in all its glory and gaze upon the vastness of space on a regular basis. And I discovered that it more or less looks the same as before, and still is just as amazing. There are few constants in life and that makes this one all the more important to me.——————Controls:“s” - Save the output as JPGOn mobile, tap multiple times to trigger download.“l” - landscape aspect ratio (default)“p” - portrait aspect ratio“o” - square aspect ratio“1” - use default resolution (1200x750 px, to ensure that it renders fast enough)“2” - increase resolution to 2560x1600 px“3” - increase resolution even more, to 5120x3200 pxURL parameters:“ratio=0.625” - Specify aspect ratio, default is 16:10 (value 0.625) which is landscape mode.

The tree, algorithmically born, gains meaning only under the scrutiny of the viewer, its binary roots sprawl not in soil, but in the mindscape where the observer's eye grafts meaning onto inert pixels.Each coded tree is more than an image -- it becomes a witnessed and possessed reality, a node in the ever-expanding forest of binary trees. This forest of possibilities -- each tree a distinct NFT -- fusing the functions and formulas with the interpretative act of minting, yields an arboreal gallery, each token an invitation to witness a singular genesis.The fabricated and natural intertwine, revealing reality as a conditioned tapestry of perception.

Cable Management,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/cable-management,working,"This piece is a reflection of my passions, a blend of the visual and the auditory, and a testament to the power of interdisciplinary inspiration.At the very core of 'Cable Management' lies the mesmerizing aura of 'Impressions of Order' by nbswwit. This piece, woven with a rich tapestry of patterns, was a visual catalyst that nudged me towards another intriguing realm: Modular Synthesizers. While many associate these intricate machines with sound, I was drawn to their visual aspect. The maze of cables, the geometric alignment of modules, the unpredictability in their assembly - all of these became pivotal visual inspirations for both the aesthetics and the very name of my piece.My deep-seated musical background has always been a reservoir of inspiration. But with 'Cable Management', my ambition was to transcend beyond the auditory. I sought not to directly incorporate sound but to let the principles of music shape the contours of my visual artwork. And in the layered structure of the artwork, I found an echo of the captivating world of polyrhythms. Just as these rhythms, when layered, weave an enchanting harmonic tapestry, the four layers in 'Cable Management', each scaling its own grid, come together to produce a visual rhythm that is both intricate and harmonious.An algorithm, teetering with a chaos factor between 95% to 99%, was my experiment in dancing on the fine line between predictability and serendipity. It was a revelation, showcasing that even when one thinks they've charted every course, there's always room for a delightful surprise, for a twist in the tale.Navigating the oscillation between chaos and order has been a profound experience. The idea of staying unwaveringly committed to an initial vision, despite the whirlwind of creativity, feels like a cherished accomplishment. And lastly, a heartfelt dedication. Through every line of code, every algorithm tweak, she remained my rock. Alice, as you embrace another year, this piece is not just an ode to my creative journey but also a heartfelt tribute to you, my biggest supporter since the outset.

Unveiled Abstraction,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/unveiled-abstraction,working,"This piece is an example of abstract artistic expression. It is presented in its pure nature, free from the pretense of representing any symbolic association with reality. It uses a combination of squares and vibrant colors to create a visual composition that focuses on pure visual aesthetics. The arrangement of the squares and the choice of vibrant colors move away from figurative representation. What's unique is that the composition of the grid is determined by prime numbers between 1 and 100. Each element in the artwork is placed in a way that interacts with the others, creating a dynamic visual experience.

L1N35 VS C1RCL35,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/l1n35-vs-c1rcl35,working,"""L1N35 VS C1RCL35"" is a digital artwork crafted with p5js that encapsulates the struggle between calculated linearity and circular grace. In this digital canvas, programming morphs into art, and algorithms turn into visual aesthetics. Each instantiation of the piece is the outcome of a set of algorithmic variables that determine form, space, and color in a choreographed confrontation.Lines, arranged with varying density depending on the iteration, create a grid that converses with circular fields, orchestrating spaces of fullness and void. The contrast of a monochromatic background, either light or dark, emphasizes the precision of ephemeral shapes that emerge from the base, initiating a visual dialogue that challenges the persistence of the viewer’s gaze.This tension field between order and chance, intention and randomness, is heightened by chromatic variations, which are themselves determined by random parameters. The saturation and brightness of the colors transform throughout the composition, in a display of subtle hues and variable intensities.In its format, which fluctuates between landscape, portrait, and square, ""L1N35 VS C1RCL35"" offers multiple perspectives on the interaction of lines and circles.

.fx(投華-touke-),https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/.fx(-touke-),working,"""投華-touke-"" refers to a blindfolded flower throwing initiation held over 1,200 years ago in Buddhism.　It involves throwing flowers onto a mandala adorned with various types of Buddha images, with the belief that one establishes a connection with the depicted deities where the flowers land. Blind turtle throwing a flower whose weight and shape are unstable experienced a sense of certainty and uncertainty, which felt them perceive the principles of Dependent Co-Arising (縁起-engi-) as the laws of the vast cosmos. And they felt guided by a transcendent power beyond human understanding (他力-tariki-).In 805, the famous Japanese Buddhist monk Kukai conducted this ritual in China and subsequently introduced the concept of two mandalas to Japan. These mandalas, known as the Taizokai Mandala and Kongokai Mandala, marked the initiation of mandalas in Japan. The oldest extant Mandala of the Two Realms created under Kukai's guidance is designated as a national treasure, representing the pinnacle of Japanese art. It is considered a depiction of the cosmic worldview of Esoteric Buddhism on a two-dimensional plane.In .fx(投華-touke-), the generation of noise function through hashing and a dual structure using two-variable trigonometric functions is employed. Constants selected through ""random()"" are also multiplied, creating complex and original patterns while preserving regularity.The role of color is to convert 3D graphs into 2D, but it also features special mechanisms within a 21-color palette.

Every responsibility, want and obligation, is not something we’re meant to face all at once. Break it up, take on one task from the pile, and focus on that.”This has been such a stable pattern that I often don’t need to hear him say it. I’ll finish describing what’s going on and stop him before he can even start, so he doesn’t have to waste his breath on something I should know by now, it’s already helping just to remember it.The best thing I can do for myself is to pick something out of the pile and handle it in isolation. I find that often each task will grow the pile exponentially. It’s easy to handle my health and fitness when that’s all I have to think about. But then I have to think about finances, maintaining friendships, taking care of my plants, dating, and finding time for a hobby. Each one of those things has its own nuances and complications.

Hospital room,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/hospital-room,working,"I have been in a mental hospital three times. The third was last summer. Mental disorder has been by my side for a long time, but last year's crisis made my life more difficult.  The crisis is my belongings. Even so, to live is too hard. Crisis deprived so many things. To relax at home, to go to school, to cook meals, to sleep, to wake up, to take a bath. And to create, to write poetry.  One of the things I could do with what was left was to read books. I wanted to somehow preserve my form, so I tried to touch books in order to live. Among them was the following haiku.退院がのびた日の昼月が窓をのぞくThe midday moon peeks through the window on the day of delayed discharge. His name is Kenshin Sumitaku. He left many haiku while he was hospitalized with leukemia. Reading his collection of haiku, ""Unfinished"" seemed to bring back memories of my hospital stay last year. I was instantly inspired and felt absolutely necessary to create this work when I touched this haiku. Perhaps the work was already asleep in my body. I discovered that haiku served as a catalyst to draw together fragments of my scattered pieces from various corners of my body and make them manifest in consciousness. I was placed in a closed ward for the first time during my third hospitalization. In a closed ward, you cannot leave the ward at all until you receive permission. I spent a lot of time in the patient's room and the ward. During such closed-off times, I felt as if I were far removed from society. However, this was something I felt anew due to being in the hospital. In reality, whether it was the challenge me before admission or the challenge me from post-discharge up to the present, I can't help but think that I've been an isolated or secluded presence from society, just like I was during my hospitalization. Interestingly, the windows of mental hospitals are not meant to be opened. You can open them just enough for a finger, but it was a stark reminder that we were firmly aware of being isolated and confined. However, it excelled at offering a view, and since the hospital was by the sea, I could enjoy the beautiful ocean every day. I don't really understand how to open a window, but I think the fragmented windows of NFTs, when opened through the act of purchase, being glimpsed by someone, might make me feel less lonely. The fragment of myself in the NFT is not a hidden entity, nor is it an isolated one. I pray that I can become such an existence. This NFT is only a part of the work. Later I will report on the ""Hospital room"" as fx(text). I will write about what I tried to do, what I tried to put into the parameters of the work, my life and disabilities that are inseparable from the work, and the situation I am in in Japanese society. I will post the report on X @shirasu_nejio. I hope you will read it as well. Also, I was taking documentary videos during the production.

Linear Perturbations,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/linear-perturbations,working,"Lines, our simple geometric friends, are nice and neat ideal forms. Until they’re not. Here they shake, crumble, twist and bend. Just like everything else in our fragile world. We put a lot of faith in lines, from marking out political borders to defining our designs, but maybe they aren’t as reliable as they seem.In this work we make small, probing journeys into the space between pure shiny mathematics and the brittle chaos of materiality that this math tries to define. Between the abstract and the concrete we find a gap; a gap where the idealised theories about reality interface awkwardly with the way things actually are.I like to think about this breakdown and how it raises questions about our theories of the world. We need to trust that basic primitives like lines behave predictably, but it’s also important to realise that our grasp is slippery. It’s particularly fun to try and illustrate this thought using code. Using numbers and computations we end up with a metaphor for the limits of these things!Made with p5.js and two shader passes, this work begins with a simple shape--a circle or a square--that hides in the background and seeps through to the lines. The first pass draws lines horizontally at a variety of densities and become perturbed by layers of gradient noise, at varying degrees of scale and strength. Then the result gets interpreted into color. We have five palettes reminiscent of the world. Finally, the whole scene passes through a second shader which usually applies a a twist, causing the lines to skew and warp.There’s sand in the gears of where our minds meet matter. Sometimes unnoticed, sometimes with pleasure, and sometimes with angst. But always with a kind of truth. And I hope this work can conjure a kind of hazy evocation of all this.

Participants will learn what generative art is and will make some themselves.What is this workshop all about?This workshop introduces the concepts of generative art and focuses on creating pieces using basic drawing tools, rules sets, and chance. The workshop strives to be hands-on and collaborative.Who is it for??Are you curious about the world of generative art and want to try it yourself?Are you intrigued by the interplay between human creativity and rule-driven processes?Do you have little to no prior experience in generative art but are excited to explore the possibilities?Then this workshop is for you!! We will endeavour to push the boundaries of conventional art and delve into the realms of generative creation.While individuals with programming and digital art backgrounds might be intrigued, no computers will be involved in this workshop. The focus is on hands-on, analog generative art creation.What is Generative Art?Generative Art originated in the early 1960s with pioneering artists such as Vera Molnár and Manfred Mohr. It has roots in the early computer graphics and music experiments of that era. While it is typically associated with computers and code, the underlying principles of rules and constrained randomness lend it to any number of artistic mediums.How do you make a piece of Generative Art?To create a generative work of art, the artist defines a set of rules that are set into motion with some degree of randomness contributing to the completed artwork. A simple example is to create a 4x4 grid where each square is filled with varying colours based on inputs such as coin flips, or dice rolls. The resulting artworks are unique and original each time by following the same rules.To fully realize a generative work of art, the artist must surrender some control over the final output to random chance. This uncertainty in the final output challenges ideas of authorship and explores the relationship between human creativity and machine-like processes.What materials are required for this?All materials can be either brought from home or purchased at a local dollar store.- Pens or fine tipped markers (approx 6 colours),- Pencils (regular graphite and approx 6 colours),- Pencil Sharpener- Ruler,- Eraser,- A pad of grid paper, approx 8.5”x11”,- A pad of sketching or watercolour paper, approx 8.5”x11”,- Pair of dice,- Deck of playing cards,- A coin to flip.Where will the workshop be held?The workshop will take place at the Gerrard Art Space (GAS) in Toronto, Canada. It is a wonderful gallery in the east-end neighbourhood of Little India.https://www.gerrardartspace.com/""",Unknown

diT͟Hər(ism),https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/dither(ism),working,"…[O]ne of the earliest [applications] of dither came in World War II. Airplane bombers used mechanical computers to perform navigation and bomb trajectory calculations. Curiously, these computers (boxes filled with hundreds of gears and cogs) performed more accurately when flying on board the aircraft, and less well on ground. Engineers realized that the vibration from the aircraft reduced the error from sticky moving parts. Instead of moving in short jerks, they moved more continuously. Small vibrating motors were built into the computers, and their vibration was called dither from the Middle English verb ""didderen,"" meaning ""to tremble."" Today, when you tap a mechanical meter to increase its accuracy, you are applying dither, and modern dictionaries define dither as a highly nervous, confused, or agitated state. In minute quantities, dither successfully makes a digitization system a little more analog in the good sense of the word.— Ken Pohlmann, Principles of Digital AudioIn this collection of mine, I focused on textures created repeatedly by dither, ASCII, and glitch effects in a random flow.

Each meticulous and detailed stroke seeks to capture the grandeur that this magnificent building once had. Although time has gradually erased the details, the pillars stand firm, silent witnesses of a glorious past.At the last minute, I decided to add colors and focus on the play of shadows. I used shading to enhance the texture and dimension of the pillars, creating subtle contrasts that enhance their presence amidst the forest. The light filtered through the tree leaves casts soft and ethereal shadows, adding a touch of mystery and atmosphere to the scene.The natural environment surrounding the pillars comes to life through fluid and organic lines representing the vegetation. Nature has taken over the space, enveloping the remains in a serene yet powerful embrace.

The foreground cells represent the initial state of the system that we are simulating.The initial state displays for 2.5 seconds.The simulation is then run, and the Game of Life rules are applied to each cell.

In this sense, it seeks to convey a powerful metaphor about the collaboration between human ingenuity and mechanical precision.Elements of pointillism are incorporated into this artwork, as with this artistic technique, the patterns created are not generated through long and fluid strokes but rather composed of small figures such as circles, triangles, or squares of various sizes. These points, when visually mixed, can create the illusion of smoother and more subtle shapes, tones, and textures in the artwork.===============Controls (in live view)===============To download the .SVG file, press [s], wait a few seconds for the algorithm to render in a new environment, and start the download.

They may shroud the tree in a gentle mist, delicately frame a set of bare branches, conjure the semblance of a face, or take on the appearance of wisps of smoke emanating from a tree ablaze. At times, they become the trailing exhaust of a rocket, create the foundational contours of a mountain crowned by a lone tree, or mimic a boulder descending from the heavens.Furthermore, the palette of colors and the patterns of organic brushstrokes that breathe life into each scene are a source of boundless diversity.

Imagine myself at the center of a virtual world, where the rules of art and science merge into a harmonious dance.In the center of the stage stands the ""Cellular Automaton,"" a digital entity with a life of its own. This entity is composed of a grid of cells, each with a state, 0 or 1, like two actors taking turns on the stage. Each turn, these actors follow a pre-defined script, the ""rules,"" which change their state based on their past behavior. It's as if the stage itself is a fabric in constant transformation, woven by the very rules.Beyond the main stage, there's a secondary dance in progress. Here, ""particles"" elegantly move through a flow field. This field is generated by the art of noise, where chaos and randomness create seemingly random beauty. The particles follow the flow, dancing through invisible currents, like leaves drifting in a mountain stream.The particles themselves are like digital brushstrokes on the virtual canvas. Each particle has a position, a velocity, and a color. When a particle passes through a certain region, the color on the canvas changes, like a work of art evolving and transforming. It's a symphony of shapes and colors, guided by mathematics and randomness.As the show progresses, the digital world comes to life, creating a unique visual and artistic experience. It's an ever-evolving work of art, a harmony between the precision of mathematical rules and the freedom of artistic expression.

Somewhere in between is some yet-to-be-determined point at which beautiful unexpected forms emerge.This system takes the standard model of equal exchange and throws it off balance, so each reaction will randomly decide which side has an advantage over the other, and instead of dispersal, one force will win out.In this system, do similar complex patterns appear? Will we see anything new that doesn't appear with our usual rules?I found this idea very interesting, that even with no law towards chaos, actually the opposite, we can still end in formlessness.

"Out With the Old, In With the New",https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/out-with-the-old-in-with-the-new,working,"One can imagine a room, a special room that’s been with you throughout your life. This room is filled with objects, each one a testament to a different period in your life. Some items may seem outdated, no longer serving a purpose, while others remain timeless and cherished.When you step into this room, you begin the process of clearing out these items. But this isn’t just about discarding what’s no longer needed. Each item you touch brings back a flood of memories, a story, a lesson learned. They have influenced you, contributed to your growth, and played a significant role in your journey.Think now of bringing new items into this room. Each addition isn’t merely about embracing novelty or trendiness. It’s a symbol of your commitment to growth, evolution, and progress. These new additions reflect your current tastes, your aspirations, and your journey. They represent who you are now and who you aspire to be.Often it’s important to note that the new isn’t always better than the old, and sometimes it may even seem less perfect. But the beauty of life lies in its imperfections and our ability to embrace them. Accepting the new for what it is, is indeed a form of growth. It’s about understanding that change is a part of life, and not all changes will feel like improvements initially.It’s worth noting that our surroundings, the tools we use, our possessions, and our personal identities all play significant roles in this journey towards perfection. They shape us and our environment in distinctive ways. Even if they are not perfect themselves, they contribute uniquely to our growth and progress.We are constantly evolving in life, learning from our past and looking forward to the future. We let go of old habits, beliefs, and experiences that no longer serve us and embrace new ones that propel us forward. Each step we take, each change we make, brings us closer to becoming the best version of ourselves.Therefore remember, every time you clear out your room or introduce something new to it, you’re not just dealing with objects. You’re acknowledging your past, embracing your present, and looking forward to your future.Nevertheless, it’s important to understand that perfection isn’t about eliminating flaws or relentlessly chasing an ideal state. It’s about appreciating both the old and the new, the perfect and the imperfect. In conclusion, every old thing we let go makes room for something new in our lives. This process is more than just a call for change. It serves as a reminder to cherish every step of our journey towards perfection - to value where we’ve been as much as where we’re going.---------------------------------Press s to save the imagePress a to skip the animation.---------------------------------By munich_MW - Created with p5js---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",Unknown

Suddenly, I found something that reminded me of blooming meadows, it was in tune with my state at that moment. So I started to develop this theme. I did not aim to turn it into a realistic picture. The images were supposed to remain abstract, just to convey the general mood and impressions I was feeling. Initially, it was a story about summer meadows and grasses. But in the process, I had memories of impressions that arose in different seasons, which I observed in nature here. Colour became the main conductor of the story about various states of nature. It is common to see a lot of black soil in spring through which fresh shoots break through, creating bright splashes on a dark background. During the early summer, the area is covered in lush grasses and wildflowers, as well as butterflies. The world blooms and life is reborn. Eventually, the grasses wither due to the hot sun. Sun-burnt straw sheaves take on a special beauty and texture.  As autumn approaches, we turn to the terracotta range, which offers a variety of ripe mature flowers. Winter is all about graphics. During this period, I usually like to take black and white pictures. Every time, every state of nature has its own beauty.

As a devoted admirer of color, Iskra's foray into 2023 marks a pivotal juncture in her creative journey, one aimed at establishing a robust framework and foundation for her artistic endeavors. While color serves as the conduit for emotion and expression, the frame and body of her work provide the essential principles and statements. Discovering certainty within these foundational elements is a pivotal step in her quest to gain a deeper understanding of the origins of emotion when color bursts onto the scene.Iskra now unveils her latest creation. EDNŌ alludes phonetically to the manner in which ""1"" is pronounced in Bulgarian. Following her earlier exploration, ""ESCAPE,"" encapsulated as exploration number 0, Iskra initiates a culturally nuanced taxonomy that will serve as an overarching framework for future works.Despite the absence of overt emotions, ""EDNŌ"" is not devoid of narrative depth. It draws strong inspiration from one of cinema's most impactful moments – the ending scene of ""Zabriskie Point”, a 1970 film directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, known for its surreal and symbolic elements. It explores themes such as youth rebellion, the alienation of modern society, and the search for personal freedom and meaning.View the scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUVM1Pq2VWY&t=130sThe film's climax features a spectacular explosion of a suburban home, which can be seen as a symbol of the rejection of the establishment and a call for radical change.  The structural composition of this work lies on its simplicity, much akin to the cryptic nature of the cinematic finale it alludes to. Its interpretation, however, unfolds as an open canvas for each observer, fostering a subjective engagement. Iskra employs a methodical arrangement of elements, deploying the interplay between stark blacks and whites to serve as an illuminating agent, accentuating the nuances of individual pixels. This digital chiaroscuro is presented a part of the canvas or sometimes confined inside a container. In both representations the interaction of the user initiates the explosion.It is, dear viewer, a contemplative question that remains - once the detonation transpires, would you prefer to find yourself contained within the box or liberated beyond its confines? The answer, an open canvas for interpretation, is yours to discern.  While the whole system alludes exclusively to its monochromatic approach, a few outputs dissipate into wisps of smoke. That decision opened the door for a few emotions to hack it. The chill of detachment, represented with blue and green tones, and the warmth of affection, represented by red and pink ones.Features:SmokeEmotionConditionCommands:Each piece is created to be seen as a static composition.

The way the gradients blend into the larger background also depends on the mint: some blend completely, while other tend to the background color but never quite reach it.## Keyboards controls ##'s' saves a high-res version of your output (4096x4096 px)‘m’ saves a low-res version (500 x 500 px), useful for social media'p' saves TWO smartphone formatted crops (1176 x 2556 px) so you can take your mint with you all day - one in full saturation, one at half saturation - you can use one for your lockscreen and one for your homescreen, for example, or you can make your own crops from the high-res image.## Technical note ##Depending on the size of your window, the number of steps may vary.

The Glyph Eye,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/the-glyph-eye,working,"This generative artwork was inspired by a set of glyphs designed by my friend Chris Scussel. The glyph set is a collection of 256 unique symbols that are similar to symbol fonts in appearance.Chris created his glyphs in PostScript. After analyzing them, I was able to write simple JavaScript routines to draw each glyph based on a number pair.I put my glyph generating code to the test by employing my ""Boxes"" scheme. Within that scheme, I use a variety of random techniques to place and choose individual glyphs, as well as several approaches to add color. Ninety percent of the time, I color the image, but ten percent of the time, I fall back to black and white to honor the original design.I find the image visually interesting because the design of the glyphs and their placement with respect to each other within the picture space exhibit many gestalt principles. Moreover, the Boxes algorithm subjectively produces a perceptible ""eye"" in the viewer's mind, which is another gestalt event.Enjoy.Please visit: www.drbillkolomyjec.com",Unknown

Subsequently, a particulate element follows an intricate path within the irregular grid, leaving a trail of colors and moving shapes, forming a visual choreography.

"Ikigai ""reason to get up in the morning” ",https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/ikigai-%22reason-to-get-up-in-the-morning%22,working,"Art is an intricate tapestry woven into the very fabric of society, reflecting and shaping the ethos of its time. As an art theorist, I believe that art is not a mere reflection of society but an active participant in its evolution. It serves as a mirror that captures the collective consciousness, shedding light on societal values, aspirations, and even its struggles. Through the strokes of a painter's brush, the words of a poet's pen, or the notes of a composer's melody, artists channel their perceptions and emotions, offering a unique lens through which we can interpret the world around us. Moreover, art has the power to challenge conventions, question norms, and provoke dialogue, thereby influencing the course of societal progress. In essence, art and society are inextricably linked, each influencing and being influenced by the other, in a dynamic dance that enriches our cultural heritage and shapes the very essence of human experience. In this collection of mine, I have finally realized the superficial design compositions I have wanted to create for a long time. To be honest, there's no need for many words; I aimed to make compositions aesthetically pleasing as they came to me naturally. I always applied the Gestalt theories I consider as rules in composition creation, and sometimes, I even went beyond these rules. Actually, one of my main goals in this composition was to create a different awareness. I know that artists should see the value of their efforts. It's important not only in terms of material aspects but also to receive appreciation. However, I am aware that in the NFT space, it is evident that everything is quite self-centered, there is indifference towards society, and personal gains are in the foreground. FxHash opened a new door for me in my art career. I think I didn't get the recognition I deserved in my physical art life because I strived to be original and avoid insincere relationships. But this place has given me a new excitement. I also want to reciprocate that. To the best of my ability, I have established a mint mechanism for the community. I have tried to keep the prices reasonable and avoid Dutch auctions to make my works accessible to everyone. In this collection, I will use the Dutch auction mechanism and distribute the primary and royalty splits to various institutions in different proportions.*Save image: press 'S' to save the current image as png.

Colour streaks,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/colour-streaks,working,"Colour streaks refer to vibrant and bold streaks of different colors, which involve creating vibrant and dynamic combinations using streaks or lines of different colors. Characterized by their bold and energetic appearance, colors are often combined and layered to create a sense of movement and depth.Different techniques are usually used to apply colors on canvas or paper. This can include brush strokes, palette knives, or even pouring paint directly onto the surface. Colors are usually applied in long, flowing strokes, creating a sense of flow and rhythm.Colors have a great influence on the mood and overall effect of the artwork. I chose complementary colors to create contrast and visual interest, and similar colors for a more harmonious and relaxing effect.One of the key aspects of colour streaks is their ability to evoke emotion and stimulate the viewer's imagination. Vibrant colors and dynamic combinations often evoke feelings of joy, energy, or excitement. Flowing lines and color combinations can also create a sense of movement or evoke natural elements such as water or wind.Overall, colour streaks are a visually appealing form of abstract expression that celebrates the beauty and power of color.

Creature Interpolation,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/creature-interpolation,working,"Creature Interpolation is a way to create new and interesting images from a database of creature outlines that I created in the 1970s. The original outlines were hand-drawn on graph paper, and each one was ""half-drawn"" on the vector x=y. I used FORTRAN code to read in the coordinates of the half-figure and reflect those points programmatically into complete, closed outlines. This ensures that the interpolated images are always smooth and closed.To create a new image, I randomly place one of the four creature outlines in each corner of a grid. I then rotate each outline by a random number of degrees. Next, I use linear interpolation to create all the in-betweens for each row of the grid. This creates a smooth transition between the four outlines. I then use linear interpolation to form the vertical columns of the grid, interpolating between the rows. This process is more commonly known as bi-linear interpolation.In 75% of the cases, I do not add color to the image. This keeps the image true to the original plotter drawings from the 1970s, which were black pen on a white background. However, in 25% of the cases, I fill the interpolated shapes with bi-linear interpolated color. I do this by randomly assigning four colors to the picture space. Then, I assign each creature outline a color based on its relative position in the space.I hope you enjoy this blast from the past!Please visit: www.drbillkolomyjec.com",The library mentioned in the text is: p5.js

Mudaashiku,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/mudaashiku,working,"Mudaashiku (「無駄足区」- “Fool’s Errand District”) invokes the place where you first really experienced what it means to be a person in a city. Were you awestruck? Did you feel lost or disoriented by a realization of the size of the spaces around you? Perhaps you sought some detail, some small thing to focus on to reorient yourself and feel like a person again in the face of such immensity and confusion.This work is inspired by an attempt to capture some of the feeling I had when I first moved to Tokyo and was utterly overwhelmed. It was both exciting and frightening to suddenly be lost in a place so immense and unfamiliar. If Stendhal Syndrome refers to the fearful ecstasy of experiencing the beauties of Florence, then there must be something similar for the first experience of a great city.

The Palette of Pessimism,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/the-palette-of-pessimism,working,"Amidst the vibrant palettes and strokes that should effortlessly flow, there might arise a gnawing void, an expanse of white that feels overwhelming and infinite. A realm where every dab of color seems both too bold and too faint, a testament to a struggle that outsiders often romanticize but seldom truly comprehend.The creative endeavor, no matter how noble or revered, isn't immune to the pangs of self-doubt and the pressures of perceived norms. The expectation of producing profoundness can sometimes feel like an anchor, threatening to pull you under the weight of what art is supposed to be. Consider perhaps the true essence of creation isn't just about the creation itself, but the myriad of emotions and vulnerabilities that shape it. It's about the journey of diving deep within, sifting through the chaos, and, in doing so, finding pockets of peace and clarity.While the world might insistently measure the value of your art by its reception by the crowd, its true worth lies in the sincerity of its expression. When the silence of the blank canvas gets deafening, remind yourself that the act of creating, with all its messiness and uncertainty, is a testament to your courage and strength. Sometimes, the mere act of picking up the brush, of engaging with the canvas, is a step forward, a silent, yet profound, triumph over doubt and fear.",

Asta Collection,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/asta-collection,working,"Asta by Infinity Luna======================Welcome to the World of ""Asta"": Where Geometry Meets MythologyWhen I set out to create ""Asta,"" I found myself entangled in a web of concepts that span both mathematical precision and mythological grandeur. Named after the Old Norse term, ""Ástríðr,"" which brings together ""ás"" — the divine — and ""fríðr"" — the beautiful, the name ""Asta"" embodies the essence of this piece. Like the gods and goddesses of Old Norse lore, ""Asta"" exists in a realm where contrasting forces of unity and fragmentation, chaos and order, collide and coalesce.The artwork features a mesmerizing array of concentric circles, meticulously crafted from individual spheres. Each circle holds its own universe, much like the gods held sway over various domains—yet all are part of a larger cosmic pattern. The Norse gods themselves were intricate characters, embodiments of both admirable qualities and human flaws, and this duality resonates in every sphere and every orbit within ""Asta.""The backdrop for this celestial assembly is a distressed canvas. Just as the gods had to deal with the entropy and decay inherent in the cosmic cycle—often represented by the serpent Jormungandr, who bites its own tail to form a circle—the background of ""Asta"" captures the disarray that is forever intertwined with order. Circles that have lost their center float aimlessly like fallen gods, reflecting the beauty of imperfection and the unpredictability of life.In ""Asta,"" you’re invited on a philosophical journey that transcends the visual experience. As your gaze drifts across the intricate patterns and lingering anomalies, each element becomes symbolic of the eternal dualities that the Norse gods so vividly embodied—order and chaos, the finite and the infinite, the divine and the mortal.I invite you to dive into the depths of ""Asta,"" to ponder, to question, and to feel the pulse of ancient myths echoing in the silent geometry. For me, ""Asta"" is not just an art piece; it's a poetic encounter with the sublime, an homage to the complexities that life and myth offer us.Browser Recommendations------------------------ Chrome and Safari browsers are recommended.- Firefox isn't currently supported, but most chromium-based browsers should function.Controls--------The controls are as follows:- Press `t` - 370 x 200 png output (thumbnail)- Press `1` - 650 x 1200 png output- Press `2` - 1300 x 2400 png output- Press `3` - 1950 x 3600 png output- Press `4` - 3250 x 6000 png output- Press `5` - 5200 x 9600 png output- Press `6` - 7800 x 14400 png outputPlease note that the larger the output, the longer it will take to generate.Acknowledgments---------------Code contributions from the following individuals were integrated and modified to develop this artwork:- [Steve's Makerspace](https://linktr.ee/steves_mspace) - The background texture generation was sourced from examples provided by Steve's Makerspace and adjusted to meet the specific needs of this project.

Limits of Infinite Space,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/limits-of-infinite-space,working,"In this work, infinite growth becomes a visual metaphor illustrating how space expands infinitely within defined boundaries. Similar to the mathematical concept where the limit of a function can be equal to 1 as ""x"" tends to infinity, one can observe how infinite expansion comes to a halt at a boundary represented by the thick straight line in the middle of this artistic creation.As this expansion continues, something astonishing happens: space emerges and materializes. The concentric shapes stretching into infinity create layers upon layers of space that, even though arising from a seemingly endless process, define and delineate clear areas within the canvas. This duality between unlimited growth and the creation of space reveals the beauty and paradox of how even in the pursuit of the infinite, defined spaces can be found within the confines of the finite.",
Words on Canvas,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/words-on-canvas,working,"""Words on Canvas"" is a work of art that finds its inspiration in two pieces that I sincerely deeply admire. The first of them is ""Space & Ego"", a Pixel Symphony creation. In this work, we explore the fascinating notion of distributing polygons irregularly, weaving random patterns and colors into a previously defined space. The second source of inspiration is ""Universal Rayhatcher,"" a masterpiece conceived by Piter Pasma. From this piece, we extract the bold idea of breaking with the traditional seed, generally based on a number as a starting point.Let me now delve into the most intriguing aspects of this work:✅ [Title Seed]: Often, we are used to representing the seed of a work by a simple number. However, in this case, I have decided to do something different. The seed that will give life to your creation will be a phrase that you write yourself in the corresponding field. By altering the phrase, you will experience new and unique visual outputs. It is important to note that what you write as a seed will be reflected in the characteristics of the work, and all those who appreciate it will be able to see it. I kindly ask you to maintain a respectful tone when selecting the title. Don't worry if someone else chooses a similar title; the result will always be distinctive.✅[Stroke color ]: In the upper left corner (in minting context) you can find a select that contains the colors of the color palette that you previously selected in the [ Color palette ] parameter. This will allow you to swap the color of the lines and the image frame (if it is visible). The color selected for the lines will not be used to fill the other elements of the canvas.I hope you like the idea and I want to see your creations!by RosbelDev",

The concept is inspired by the traditional Sumi-e philosophy that every brush stroke is a defining move. We aimed to introduce a level of intention and directionality to the generative algorithm, much like a human painter's approach to their art.Our primary source of inspiration is the timeless beauty and simplicity of Sumi-e painting, pioneered by numerous esteemed artists, such as Shozo Sato, Qi Baishi, Xu Wei, Shitao, Katsushika Hokusai, and Sesshū Tōyō. The essential principles of Sumi-e provided us with a unique lens to explore digital generativity in art.Our process mirrored the chronological nature of a painter's approach - top to bottom, left to right. We started with elemental shapes and iteratively refined them, emulating the Sumi-e single stroke technique. The creation of each element was unique, from mountains to cherry blossoms. Gradually, the algorithm started taking form as an invisible ink painter behind the computer screen, making autonomous artistic decisions.The foundation of ""Dio"" is a robust system capable of rendering diverse outputs. We developed a digital infrastructure capable of producing unique brush strokes on the fly, respecting the rules and parameters set for each element. A spectrum of elements, including sun, clouds, peaks, lake, hills, birds, and cherry blossoms, are shuffled to create the final composition. It's a fully coded painting process where the final visual outcome is the pure result of chance, bound only by the rules we implemented.""Dio"" (דיו), which means ink in Hebrew, has been our working title throughout the project.

Named after the Old Norse term, ""Ástríðr,"" which brings together ""ás"" — the divine — and ""fríðr"" — the beautiful, the name ""Asta"" embodies the essence of this piece. Like the gods and goddesses of Old Norse lore, ""Asta"" exists in a realm where contrasting forces of unity and fragmentation, chaos and order, collide and coalesce.The artwork features a mesmerizing array of concentric circles, meticulously crafted from individual spheres. Each circle holds its own universe, much like the gods held sway over various domains—yet all are part of a larger cosmic pattern. The Norse gods themselves were intricate characters, embodiments of both admirable qualities and human flaws, and this duality resonates in every sphere and every orbit within ""Asta.""The backdrop for this celestial assembly is a distressed canvas. Just as the gods had to deal with the entropy and decay inherent in the cosmic cycle—often represented by the serpent Jormungandr, who bites its own tail to form a circle—the background of ""Asta"" captures the disarray that is forever intertwined with order. Circles that have lost their center float aimlessly like fallen gods, reflecting the beauty of imperfection and the unpredictability of life.In ""Asta,"" you’re invited on a philosophical journey that transcends the visual experience. As your gaze drifts across the intricate patterns and lingering anomalies, each element becomes symbolic of the eternal dualities that the Norse gods so vividly embodied—order and chaos, the finite and the infinite, the divine and the mortal.I invite you to dive into the depths of ""Asta,"" to ponder, to question, and to feel the pulse of ancient myths echoing in the silent geometry. For me, ""Asta"" is not just an art piece; it's a poetic encounter with the sublime, an homage to the complexities that life and myth offer us.Controls========The controls are as follows:- Press `t` - 370 x 200 png output (thumbnail)- Press `1` - 650 x 1200 png output- Press `2` - 1300 x 2400 png output- Press `3` - 1950 x 3600 png output- Press `4` - 3250 x 6000 png output- Press `5` - 5200 x 9600 png output- Press `6` - 7800 x 14400 png outputPlease note that the larger the output, the longer it will take to generate.Acknowledgments===============Code contributions from the following individuals were integrated and modified to develop this artwork:- [Steve's Makerspace](https://linktr.ee/steves_mspace) - The background texture generation was sourced from examples provided by Steve's Makerspace and adjusted to meet the specific needs of this project.

Salome,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/salome,working,"Salome and The Dance of the Seven veilsAccording to ten verses of Matthew 14, John was imprisoned for criticizing King Herod Antipas's marriage to Herodias, the former wife of Antipas's half-brother Herod II. Herod offered his niece a reward of her choice for performing a dance for his guests on his birthday. Herodias persuaded her daughter to ask for John the Baptist's head on a platter. Against his better judgment, Herod reluctantly acceded to her request. (Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_of_the_Seven_Veils)Salome dances before the King, her body is defined by a field of leopard spots placed on a distorted mesh field. The mesh warping algorithm was created by my friend Christopher Scussel. There are controls in Chris' algorithm that allow me to strategically place ""bulges"" and"" ""dents"" on the field suggesting the shape of Salome's torso.Salome's torso is covered with at least one or up to seven veils created from stacking layers of a second Scussel warped mesh algorithm. Each layer is rendered using its own set of random variables making them appear to be swirling. Stacking these layers produces complex surface movement and interactions of intricate moiré patterns. The colors of the layers are based on a set of random analogous colors. As the viewer generates more and more instances, Salome's dance is revealed.(c) 2023 Dr. Bill Kolomyjec & Christopher ScusselPlease visit www,drbillkolomyjec.com",

Created in Cables.gl, ""Now There’s None of You Left"" is made from layers of randomly generated transparent shapes and various noise textures that are then distorted with a combination of Perlin and Simplex noise. The distortion is also built up in multiple layers, making the shapes sometimes overlay or coil over each other. All these layers of shapes, textures, noises, and distortions create a complex composition that illustrates distorted memories and eroded mind. The resulting scene can look tranquil, sometimes violent, sometimes almost empty. Strands of memory, tendrils of emotions, all brewing in the broth of forgetfulness.

Move the parameters freely to create your designs.However, completion is short-lived.In a matter of seconds, the copies multiply repeatedly.Modifications, alterations, and revisions are applied to the objects.Concurrently, the paper's decay and replication-induced noise compound on the drawing's surface.This process repeats, archives, and...The drawing becomes progressively more challenging to decipher.Randomized years of passage are set.The longer the passage, the lengthier the animation, and the more effects overlap on the drawing. Enjoy the evolving animation.Vertical lines flow from left to right throughout the animation.Each second represents a fictional decay of 10 years, and the year markings regress.Origin and Creation of the Artwork:Currently involved in the field of architecture, I've come across numerous old architectural drawings. These often prove difficult to interpret due to the obscurity caused by dirt and noise when compared to contemporary blueprints.While deciphering these intricate drawings, the idea emerged to represent the unique replication noise of copiers. Additionally, there's a fondness for the inherent aging of paper, which imparts a sense of history. Drawings that have been cherished and preserved for years progressively deteriorate due to fading and dirt.I aimed to combine the vintage deterioration seen in old maps and books with the noise generated by machines, creating an effect function.The effects encompass both machine noise and aging noise.For stochastic noise, I designed functions based on the same principles as actual photocopying. Colors are obtained from the original layer, slight discrepancies in position and color are introduced, and the color is redrawn.For aging noise, I incorporated effects simulating wetting and drying of paper, hole formation, rust stains, and more.Press the 's' key to save the animation as a PNG.Due to being a beginner, there might be occasional malfunctions in parameters or hash values, and I appreciate your understanding.Please share many of your original objects! With gratitude, I'll mix them all up:)I hope you enjoy it.Furthermore, I express gratitude to fxhash for allowing me to artistically manifest such ideas and share them with everyone.Also, from my early years, I've always admired my father, who used to pore over blueprints.

This abstract work is a bold exploration of the boundaries between reality and dream, a subtle dance between dimensions of perception. I forged this vision by giving life to a structure that eludes the human eye like a mirage in a scorching desert.From a distance, this creation draws the observer into a world that merges and blends with reality. The structures emerge as promises of urban architecture, but as they approach, they crumble into patterns of light and color.Colors harmoniously dance, gently fading through ethereal shades. The forms themselves seem to reject definition, refusing to adhere to the laws of perspective and geometry.The backdrop of this illusory city is a palette of chromatic emotions. Here, the boundary between the real and unreal completely dissolves, and one finds themselves wandering in a limbo of perceptions, suspended between certainty and wonder.The artwork is an invitation to explore the unknown, a celebration of the art of illusion. It is a place where the rules of physics give way to the uninterrupted dance of creativity.

OMNIA,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/omnia-1,working,"OMNIA is a generative audio-visual experience, a collaboration between a musician and two generative artists.The visuals build on simulated natural phenomena, exploring how sound-waves travel through fluids and surfaces. OMNIA has been heavily inspired by Chladni plates, stemming back to 1782 when Ernst Chladni was studying the behaviour of vibrating surfaces. He discovered that certain patterns would form when the surface was vibrated at differing frequencies. We used a closed-form solution to calculate Chladni patterns and govern a custom shader, where particles move according to the sound waves.As for the music, there are 5 different “instruments” that make up OMNIA. There’s the Boom (drums), Hum (bass), Buzz (guitar), Drip (keys) and Swoosh (sfx). Each of these instruments has 5 different variations, effectively creating 5*5*5*5*5 different unique OMNIA songs. (that’s 3125 different possibilities!)To combine these two parts we analyze the playing music on the fly, searching for spikes in the frequencies. Every time a spike hits we update the vibration of the plates, patterns form and flow following the sound.–This piece is part of the HODLERS Order and Chaos Exhibition.For this piece to run smoothly we recommend using a Chromium based browser, firefox will not work.-## Controls:- Press the “Record Videoclip” button before you start the music to save the entire video once finished.- Click / Tap to start the music once loaded.- Press S to export the current frame as a png.- Press Top Arrow to change the vibration parameters.–## RedeemablesThere’s a redeemable linked to OMNIA.

This intricate piece portrays a fusion of elements that vividly capture the essence of chaotic minds caught in perpetual distraction.A mosaic of decay and disorder. A canvas resembling a weathered metal plate forms the foundation of the piece. The plate is marked by the passage of time, bearing intricate patterns of scratches that weave across the surface like tangled thoughts. The rusted scratches crisscross haphazardly, symbolizing the disarray of neglected contemplation.Superimposed upon this corroded backdrop are bold strokes of jet-black ink. These strokes seem to have been applied with both intention and spontaneity, resembling calligraphy written in the language of frenzied thoughts. The strokes intermingle with the rust scratches, occasionally converging into enigmatic shapes or dispersing chaotically. The texture, an intricate network of independent cells, creates a three-dimensional illusion. These cells evoke the impression of neural networks, as if the very fabric of the artwork is composed of fragmented neurons that are struggling to communicate.""Disconnected Neurons"" intends to speak to the unexplored depths of the human mind.

The initial inspiration was a closeup photo that I took of a parking lot's black pavement with red and white stripes. The photo was taken during the winter when the lot was covered with ice and melting water creating an image of minimal geometry mixed with analog grain and texture. As my exploration of the algorithm advanced, the inspiration grew to include styling influences of El Lissitzky's Prouns series. Similar to Prouns, the abstract shapes generated in Scapes conjure aerial views and urban architecture. Furthermore, El Lissitzky's Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge inspired a palette constrained to black, red, and white. The Constructive art of Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge additionally inspired the forms in Scapes to be primarily composed of geometric shapes.  Scapes is a small collection reflecting the constrained nature of this piece. The scale might be small, but the output contains a lot of density that I enjoyed working into a limited palette.

.printing,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/.printing,working,""".printing"" will become one of the redeemable gifts for "".printed"" holders.Now, let's explore the merits of expressing art in the digital realm versus the realm of printed art.One significant point, in my opinion, is the difference in the colors achievable through CMYK and RGB. This also leads to variations in texture.In "".printed"" I have opted for a format where colors are selected from a designated palette. This decision is influenced by the limitations of the CMYK color gamut for printing, but it's also driven by a conscious choice to use colors like yellow, white, and black shades that evoke a sense of glossiness and beauty when printed.In this instance of "".printing"" the wide range from #000000 to #ffffff is available for selection, based on the display's color reproduction. The ability for the minter, rather than the artist, to freely choose and combine colors adds an intriguing aspect unique to the params system.Another key distinction lies in capturing a fleeting moment of fondness versus capturing an ongoing movement within the framework of code. Unlike GIFs or video files, the necessity for this art to be expressed through code, specifically p5js, is emphasized by the temporal changes brought about by noise(). The patterns in this piece possess reproducibility through a seed, yet theoretically, they continue to transform infinitely.This project stands as a significant milestone in my personal exploration of the regular variations in noise function.The pattern of this project is not perfectly symmetrical.In ""printed"" there's the joy of selecting a moment inherent to physical objects, coupled with a glossy texture.In ""printing"" the temporal evolution offered by p5js noise() function intertwines with a palette of 16,777,216 colors.I hope you find enjoyment in both aspects.Generative art by @dotconatusBuilt in Javascript with p5.js.",

Seen from the pole, Saturn reveals its rings in a unique perspective, creating a trail of mystery and wonder. The predominant colors are the various shades of white, which flake in abstract and nuanced shades, evoking the ethereal atmosphere of deep space.The abstract spectacle is orchestrated by an unceasing flow of particles. The particles dance through space, intertwining with each other in a game of invisible connections.

Rückkopplung,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/ruckkopplung,working,"Comfort. Annoyance. Pity. Surprise. Boredom. Elation. Our emotions are reactions to events that echo the past. Much of life is spent comparing present experiences with memories, and honing our ability to recognize the patterns and choices that shape us. We use this awareness and feedback to navigate our world with efficiency, simplicity, and the many resulting habits – both positive and negative. These cycles can result in mounting achievements or familiar pitfalls, but whatever they manifest, they are ceaseless and everywhere. From the repetitive cycles of birth and death, to the familiar behaviors and encounters of daily life, we are reminded that the past informs our current actions – and perpetuates a related future in what's known as ""the eternal return.""""Rückkopplung"" translates from German as ""feedback,"" and refers to the process wherein a system's output affects its input – creating a loop of influence that guides self-regulation and adaptation. When applied to the realm of human behavior, this feedback mechanism both reinforces the occurrence of patterns, and empowers us to evolve what is returned from the past. In creative systems, these loops of learning steer the subsequent step towards either harmony or chaos, minute recurring patterns or sweeping impressive strokes. The hues may converge into somber depths of melancholy, or interpose and layer with vibrant optimism. While we cannot predict what any piece of Rückkopplung will look like, its identity becomes unmistakably recognizable upon viewing.In observing how these recurring loops generate an extensive array of outcomes, yet remain undeniably familiar, we find ourselves unshackled to appreciate the diversity and unity of life, and profoundly immersed in the Art of each present moment./////TENDER x pxlshrdAugust 2023Rückkopplung is a generative art series created by pxlshrd in collaboration with Adam Berninger of Tender./////Key commands:1 = 6K with texture & margin2 = 6K w/o texture & margin8 = 12K with texture & margin (Safari on Mac only)9 = 12K w/o texture & margin (Safari on Mac only)0 = Default aspect ratio/resolutionf = Adaptive mode (fullscreen)h = Adaptive mode high resolution w/o texture & marginw = Phone wallpaperj = jpeg current resolutionp = png current resolutionMobile: Tap and hold the image for 2 seconds to save a jpg./////For the 12K export, proper rendering is only ensured when using Safari on Mac.

Space & Ego,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/space-and-ego,working,"In 1934, German philosopher Max Bense published his first work “Raum und Ich” (Space & Ego) where he explored the concept of ‘information aesthetics’, proposing that the aesthetic value of an artwork could be derived from its underlying informational structure. Bense asserted that ""Space"" extends beyond physical dimensions into the realm of abstract ideas, mathematical possibilities, and the unseen information shaping an artwork, while acknowledging its potential, boundaries, and prospects.The term ""ego,"" usually associated with an artist's subjective impulses and emotional idiosyncrasies, is redefined in Bense's framework. As technology and information theory become integrated into artistic creation, the artist's role changes from a subjective creator to an architect of information and systems.Thirty years later Manfred Mohr, an abstract expressionist, discovered Bense's information aesthetics in early 60’s, and his artistic thinking changed radically. Within a few years, his art transformed to computer generated algorithmic geometry. A pioneer of generative art, Mohr relentlessly explored precise geometric forms, symmetry, and a mathematical approach to art. While Bense’s work continues to provide a philosophical foundation and conceptual framework for generative art, Mohr demonstrated the power of computational processes to produce intellectually engaging artworks. The series 'Space & Ego' pays homage to both Bense and Mohr while initiating a dialogue. Rooted in Mohr's concept of a random point within a square, this series broadens the ""space"" made possible by evolution of generative art. While the plotters of the 1960s were confined to monochromatic outputs, I have experimented with palettes uncommon in plotter projects. My choice of colors was expressive and more in tradition with abstract expressionists of 1960s. A random point is selected within a square, and the four resulting polygons are filled with lines. The probability of these polygons being filled with lines follows four approaches, ascending and descending from top-left to bottom-right (and vice versa), and radial expansion outward (and vice versa). All works can be plotted and have been designed for a precise fill of colors within the polygons. Implemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.Press p to save a PNG of the image in full screen. Press s to save a single complete SVG file for plotting.

What you see when you open the minting interface is an editor which takes an input image provided by the minter, applies generative post-processing to it, and finally outputs an animated composition. The input image itself is compressed and stored on-chain through params mechanic as a signal in string format, retrieved every time the artwork is regenerated. Minters are in fact authors of minted tokens, implicit collaborators, who are appropriately entitled to half the royalties. To facilitate co-creation, minting process provides an intuitive interface as well as WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) for full control of the output. Effect stacks in rtrdgtzr were originally developed for the ǥᵍłˡŧᵗȼᶜħʰvᵛɍʳsˢ collection released on GlitchForge in 2023 and feature customized diffusion dithering and aberrated pixel sorting. In terms of narrative and aesthetics, these two collections form an artistic continuum.Minting interface is designed to guide the minter through the whole process in a user-friendly way. Quick visual guide as well as technical aspects of the collection are described in detail in the accompanying fx(text) article “rtrdgtzr – Minter’s Guide”. Please read it before proceeding with the mint. For more info on the curation process, please follow us on social media. If you want to contribute as an artist, reach out!The collaborative minting process was greatly inspired by “Universal Rayhatcher” from Piter Pasma and “Pensado a mano” collections from Alejandro Campos, both innovative at the time in their use of params mechanics. As we see our support for open generative tools as a mission every generative artist should partake in, rtrdgtzr is also an official entry to the fxhackathon 2023: co-creation interfaces. We hope its openness and experimental character will serve as inspiration to others. But primarily, we hope it will inspire artists who don’t work with code to contribute to it.Key controls:g: export gif animation (current output scale)s: export png image (current output scale)left + right arrow: change output scale (1x-10x)b: toggle page background colorp: pause / run animationNOTE: Minting should be done from a desktop device as the interface does not support mobile browsers (unless you find a way to drag-and-drop the image onto the canvas, in which case you’re good to go).Created with p5.js in 2023 by {protocell:labs}.Minting Instructions1.

Image editing: use keyboard keys to adjust compression quality, quantization level and image border. Click on the image to add / remove pixel squares which will later be filled with an animated pattern. The goal is to reduce characters in the signal close to the maximum allowed (2000), but this is not a requirement (experiment and see!). When done, click Refresh in the minting UI to proceed.5. Effect editing: set seed number to select an effect stack (unique set of 1000 seeds is provided for every minter wallet address). Set brightness, contrast, light and dark threshold in the minting UI to adjust the original input image and influence the output. Click Refresh again to update the output. Resize your browser window to get a larger or a smaller output (makes cycling through seed numbers faster). This is just a preview and will not affect your artwork in any other way as all output scales are always accessible later.

Naïf,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/naif,working,"""Naïf"": An Introspection on NaivetyFrom childhood, naivety is perceived as innate. It embodies a form of purity, an absence of experience that could have altered its original essence. In young adults or adults, especially in our productivity-focused societies, naivety is often seen as a weakness, a dysfunction, or even an exploitable incompetence, subject to mockery. As if the hardening process, deemed necessary to make an individual apt and conforming, had not operated satisfactorily.However, it is paradoxical to note that literature, as well as our personal experiences, are filled with examples where an adult's naivety is a strength, a means to overcome and transcend numerous obstacles. It's also a choice, conscious or unconscious, to apply a filter to the reality we observe and engage in.With advanced age, there is often a return to this naivety, a rediscovery of that lost innocence. In the elderly, this quality becomes, in a way, normal and even desirable, especially when it doesn't stem from illnesses. It reflects a form of wisdom and resilience in the face of life's complexity, a way to lighten oneself before departure.Started with doors attached to an unfinished perspective, this project became quite obsessive until revealing a meaning that I perceived as this introspection on naivety. Between art therapy and personal reflection, this work is a journey in which I visually experimented with some of my convictions that I, along the way, deconstructed.To materialize this reflection, I designed a simple drawing, naively representing a set of celestial bodies and birds through cognitive doors. These doors, fixed on a stable structure without alteration, rest on a uniform background with a slight grain.From this original view, I then revisited each element, altering them individually before recombining them. Constructing a background of simple objects, books, and childish patterns. I added a ground and clouds to anchor this confrontation to the terrestrial. The doors combine, opening to a broader vision while reducing the number of viewpoints. The structure is distorted, dissonant, resonant, colorful, sometimes overly so, even amplified, mirroring our personal structures constantly changing and confronted by life. The doors merge, increasing the surfaces and reducing the viewpoints. The birds have changed, the celestial bodies have moved, becoming denser, taking up more space, colliding, and tearing apart. Transparency emerged, allowing a glimpse of the entirety through our own doors. The reflections of different plans connect.From anarchic coloring, the lines are immature, the encounters are random. This choice reflects again the desire to preserve the dissonance induced by certain encounters and the space they occupy in our internal mechanics.This approach produced an image oscillating between disharmony and interest; sometimes pleasant, sometimes less so, even hostile or incomprehensible.This project, in its execution, is entirely random. It was created using the p5.js, p5.noise, and chroma.js libraries.The ""S"" key saves the three created images.",

Nostalgia,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/nostalgia-1,working,"Growing up, I was surrounded by artworks as my mother was an artist. One major theme of her paintings was nature. So naturally, I was influenced by mother’s career and her works. Although I ended up majoring in mechanical engineering and chose a career path in the IT industry, art was one of my major interests and from drawings, photography to generative art, always been creating some form of artworks. One major concern I have when creating a generative artwork is that as an artist, I want to create something beautiful regardless of technique while on the other hand, as an engineer, want to explore technical aspects of generative art. For “Nostalgia”, it is the former case where I focused much more on the strictly what I want to create even with less visual or technical variations. The style of art in “Nostalgia” is what I’ve been wanting to explore for some time. I wanted to combine aspects of traditional Asian art style and creative coding. To be more specific, I wanted to convey the specific mood of traditional Asian painting characterized by simple and uniform palettes and shapes. As apparent in the picture, the colors are very limited with major difference in shades which I think creates nostalgic mood hence the title “Nostalgia”.",

Interludio,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/interludio,working,"In the expansive realm of art, there exists a moment between the crescendos of expression – a pause, a stillness, a space for reflection. This moment is what we fondly refer to as an 'interlude'. It’s the silence between two musical notes, the pause between acts in a play, the space between chapters in a book. In the context of generative art, the interlude becomes an intriguing concept to explore, especially when juxtaposed against organized squares – an embodiment of order, structure, and symmetry.Generative art is an artistic practice where algorithms, primarily executed by computing processes, are employed to generate patterns, shapes, colors, and other visual phenomena. What sets generative art apart from traditional art is the role of the artist, who doesn’t merely create a static piece, but rather crafts a set of rules or algorithms that give rise to myriad unpredictable, yet bounded, outcomes. Thus, the artist becomes a designer of systems, setting the stage for creativity to emerge from a dance between chance and order.Now, let's take the motif of organized squares. At first glance, squares epitomize the very essence of order. Their four equal sides and right-angle corners are the epitome of geometric precision. They’re predictable, structured, and comforting in their uniformity. But when they become the subject of generative art, these simple squares can evolve, change, and dance in unpredictable patterns, morphing into complex configurations that are a feast for the eyes.In this context, the interlude can be envisioned as a space or a phase where the organized squares, after a frenzied bout of generative permutations, come to a fleeting moment of stillness. It's a moment where the viewer can pause, reflect, and appreciate the journey thus far, before diving back into the chaotic beauty that generative algorithms conjure.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(c) Cristian Rohr 2023Instructions: Press 'e' to export a png",
Echoes of Decay,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/echoes-of-decay,working,"Amidst an abandoned industrial backdrop, a work emerges under the title ""Echoes of Decay."" This piece seeks to encapsulate the very essence of forsaken industry and the relentless passage of time, inviting observers to introspect upon the intricate interplay between creation and deterioration.The exterior of ""Echoes of Decay"" initially manifests as a repurposed metal board, bearing the scars of prolonged exposure to the elements. The intricate patina and corrosion sprawled across the surface weave a tale of resilience and determination amidst adversity.Upon closer scrutiny, the piece unveils an intricate network of brush strokes, reminiscent of muted confessions from an enigmatic artisan. These strokes meticulously delineate regions and shapes, carving out enclaves of structure within the chaotic embrace of rust.""Echoes of Decay"" contemplates the ephemeral nature of human pursuits, offering a meditation on the subtle equilibrium between construction and dilapidation. The artist's strokes appear to reverberate with the cadence of time, capturing fleeting instances of arrangement before dissolving into the inexorable stream of decay.As one stands in the presence of ""Echoes of Decay,"" a distant symphony of machinery seems to resonate, accompanied by whispers of forgotten aspirations and the unyielding spirit of abandoned dreams. It stands as a tribute to the unwavering human tenacity that endures to make an impression, even in the face of ceaseless transformation.-	Hit s for svg export-	Hit p for png export (could take a little longer)Params for palette, form factor, mode and composition seed Minting InstructionsChoose palette, form factor and mode.

Small flags, paper balloons, and lamps are hung on public space creating a very special atmosphere and colorful landscapes. Plenty of forró (traditional music), bonfires, fireworks, typical food and drinks are part of these festivities that celebrate rural popular culture. The “Festas Juninas” (June festivities) have an important affective place in the imaginary of the Brazilian population. ""Junina"" continues the experimentations with code of my previous work ""Monotipia"". The challenge of creating graphic compositions with simple elements remains. Searching and trying to delve deeper into ways to play with the rhythm and subtleties of transparencies, colors, shapes and textures.This project is also an homage to the painters who made the Brazilian June festivities as the theme of their works, especially Alfredo Volpi (1896-1988) and Alberto da Veiga Guignard (1896-1962), but also Anita Malfatti (1889-1964), Emiliano Di Cavalcanti (1897-1976), Heitor dos Prazeres (1898-1966), and many others.---Features:-> 8 palettes (rarest = grayscale)-> 9 compositions-> Elements: 6 geometric shapes OR mixed element compositions-> 5 canvas formats: -----> tall portrait (9:16)-----> portrait (2:3)-----> square (1:1)-----> landscape (3:2)-----> wide landscape (16:9) = rarest-> Border colors: -----> soft-----> dark-----> deep gray-----> soberest color from palette-----> random color from palette (rarest)* The names of the color palettes are words related to popular June festivals.

Additionally, a pattern of on/off values is formed, of varying length, leading to a repeated pattern of gaps and lines.A second layer is added: beneath these curving, sinuous lines, points are plotted close to the limit of a circle, nearly filling the canvas. Its edges coincide with one of the points of the curves, producing an eclipsed planet; the lines seeming to dip behind its horizon.A third layer: a textured background, partially obscuring a plain-coloured canvas that forms the base of the piece.A final layer is two lines that move around or across each other, sometimes intertwining, sometimes parting.

follow my lead,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/follow-my-lead,working,"'follow my lead' is a visualization of three communities of individuals, and the ways in which they interact with each other.Using an implementation of a physarum slime mold model, I create three distinct groups of homogenous individuals, with each group having different sentiments towards the others. Individuals within a community make their best effort to follow each other around, and depending on group preferences try to either move towards or away from those in other groups.All of these interactions take place on a simulated three dimensional landscape (that varies by token), with groups of individuals having a preference towards either moving uphill or downhill.Each group begins with a different spatial distribution, such that the extent of exposure to others can change over time.For more details on the slime mold implementation and a link to the github repo containing the code, see the accompanying fx(text) article.Animation---------This is designed first as a static piece.

It can generate files to help you cut sheets of paper into postcards, business cards and other custom sizes.It is designed to be used from the params page, you do NOT need to buy or mint this project to use the tool.Please see the video linked above more more information & the instructions below.## BackgroundWhen I'm experimenting with pen plots and prints I often end up with a stack of misprints and test sheets that I don't really have a use for. At the same time, when I send plots and prints out I tend to include a couple of postcards and business cards with them.The other day I ran out of both types of card and realised I had a stack of misprints that I could use, if only there was a simple way to cut them to the right size.This tool allows you to pick the size of the plot or print you want to cut up, the size of the cards you want to cut out, and also rotate and minor position options.You can then download two SVG files (details below), one that's the card outlines, the other the corner marks. I like to use just the corner marks (I find it easier to line up), but you can use both or just the lines if you prefer.## InstructionsStep 1: Click the params button under the image to the right, or add `/explore-params` to the end of the URL above, to enter the params page for this project.Step 2: Select the paper size you are going to cut up from the `Paper Size` dropdown. All measurements are in millimetres. Standard A6 to A1 sizes are there, but if you select ""Custom"" it'll use the `Paper Width` and `Paper Height` values instead.Step 3: Set a margin, in mm. It's recommended to leave a margin of at least 3mm around the page to avoid the tick marks (and your pen and plot) going off the edge of the paper. If there's a design on the paper you're cutting up, you can set the margin to roughly match that.Step 4: Select the card size you want to cut out from the `Card Size` dropdown. Again, if you select ""Custom"" it'll use the `Card Width` and `Card Height` values instead.Step 5: Set the rotation (in degrees) of the card on the paper using the `Card Rotation` slider. My pen plots and prints often work on strong horizontal and vertical lines, and I think it looks better when the cards are rotated a bit to thrown those lines off.Step 6: You can set small offsets to the card position using the `X Offset` and `Y Offset` sliders. This is useful if you want to nudged the card position a little bit to fit more on or target a specific part of the plot or print.VERY IMPORTANT...Once you're happy with the settings, press the ""Open In New Window"" button, bottom left corner of the params window, it's labelled ""open this variant in a new tab"" when you hover over it. The ""Save SVG"" button won't work unless it's open in a new window.You can also press the 's' key, or double click the image, to save the SVG file, if for some reason you can't hit the SVG button.## HelpHit me up on YouTube or Threads if you have any questions, @revdancatt on both.",

The underlying algorithm for this piece is based on my earlier work ""Scorpion Spin"" (1970s), which was created on a plotter. At the time, plotters could only draw in black and white, so I used an overdrawing technique to create the appearance of tone.The visual elements of this piece are made up of randomly placed algorithmically drawn spirals or curls, which represent locks of hair. The number of turns, location, and rotation of each curl are all randomly determined. The total number of curls is arbitrary, but the color percentages of the curls will always be the same: 2% red, 5% blond, 11% brown or auburn, and 82% black or dark brown.The Bangert influence can be seen in the overall look and feel of the work, as well as the wobbliness of the lines that draw the spirals. The spirals are reminiscent of the human hair that inspired them, and the wobbly lines add a sense of movement and energy to the piece.** https://www.drbillkolomyjec.com/events-and-media/art-in-art-out/structure-study-2Please visit www.drbillkolomyjec.com(c)2023 Dr. Bill Kolomyjec.

HexaCity,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/hexacity,working,"The idea of designing an urban facade came to my mind in 2019, but it was postponed for various reasons. A few months ago I refocused on this project and after reviewing the available examples I decided to use a specific style to implement it.This algorithm depicts an isometric view of a city. Therefore, the basis of this algorithm is isometric design.Isometric drawing comes from the Greek ""iso metro,"" meaning equal measure. This is because the angle between the x, y, and z axes is 120°. It's a form of axonometric perspective (there is no foreshortening). In other words, face lines are all drawn from the same angle.The advantage of drawing this way is that an object can be freely rotated, re-positioned, and reoriented without redrawing it. There is also no change in scale when an object is moved forward or backward.One of the features of using this style is that with a suitable combination of colors at different angles, you can quickly achieve 3D output with a 2D design.Each building is individually designed after determining its height with a random algorithm, then one of dozens of random roof design algorithms is called for finalization.Two types of scale combinations have been used for building scale, one is buildings with the same scale. In this combination, large-scale structures are formed when buildings are placed next to each other. And in other compositions, the integration of different scales creates more depth and variety.Made by p5.jss = save",

This composition, dear art collector, is not flawed. No, it's something more painfully familiar — it's dull. The artist, in what must have been a moment of nostalgia for clichés, has trotted down a path so well-worn that even the most novice art student would likely avoid it. It's a dance we've all seen, like the macabre waltz of a paint-by-numbers set come to life. Like a warm bowl of oatmeal, it offers sustenance without the burden of taste.Could this be an intentional homage to mediocrity? A cheeky nod to the artistic platitudes we've all come to know and love? Or perhaps not love? If so, the irony is buried so deep beneath layers of predictability, you'd need the Hubble Telescope to find it, and even then, you might just mistake it for a smudge on the lens.And then, the matter of price — or rather, the absence thereof. One would think ""free"" might absolve many sins, but in this case, it feels like an overvaluation. Why, one might argue that the mere act of hanging this piece would cost wall space that could be better used for, say, a charming reproduction of dogs playing poker.That's not to say the work is entirely without merit. Some might find comfort in its familiarity or even a certain charm in its unpretentiousness. Perhaps in a dimly lit corner of a forgotten hallway - it's an echo in a world teeming with voices, a muted belch in the grand opera of contemporary art.Perhaps the artist intended to challenge our expectations by meeting none of them. If so, I submit my congratulatory nod. The artist's next endeavor may yet surprise and delight us in the future. But as for this piece, it seems destined to linger in obscurity, a footnote in an art history book that no one will read. Even without a price tag, it seems to ask too much of us — namely, our time, our patience, and a suspension of our good taste.In the end, dear connoisseurs of the sublime and the ridiculous, we are left with an artwork that's as challenging as a jigsaw puzzle with all edge pieces. It's a lesson in how to fill space without filling our souls. It's free, yes, but so is the advice to leave it where you found it.

These artefacts have been somehow pierced, leaving behind holes in distinctive but unknown patterns. Their surfaces have been marked by the passage of time. Maybe the patterns are a message. Or a map. Or a clue. Perforations explores the idea of communicating across vast time scales, where there is no common language between those who left the artefacts and those who found them.

.printed,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/.printed,working,"This artwork is a contemplation of human learning and cognitive processes, juxtaposing printed fabric and digitally created art composed of pixels. The commonality between physical fabric and fabric composed of pixels lies in the act of perceiving a collection of threads or pixels as one unified cloth.The act of interpreting a collection of threads as one fabric reflects the complexity of human cognition from a metaphysical perspective. It involves perceiving individual threads as having common universal characteristics and unifying them under the universal concept of fabric to understand the existence of the object. Based on principles of form perception and category theory, humans group objects based on similarities and shared attributes, embodying a profound thought process of understanding and giving meaning to the world.On the other hand, the current hottest topic in digital perception is deep learning's recognition and learning processes. In the mechanism of information integration, deep learning employs mathematical operations to convert information into flat representations. For instance, in multi-modal processing, different information sources such as images and text are transformed into vectors or tensors and integrated to generate comprehensive representations. Going beyond the frame problem, achieving artificial intelligence with the same flexibility and insight as general human intelligence is a personally intriguing question.If you observe the clothes you are wearing now, you may notice the appearance of threads weaving into fabric even with the naked eye. However, upon magnification, you may find that the threads are even thinner, and further magnification might reveal them as clusters of molecules or atoms. The ability to infer concepts without the need for such detailed observation exemplifies the flexibility and insight of human intelligence and the awe-inspiring nature of natural sciences.In this project,you offer the option to redeem the artwork for a traditional Japanese wrapping cloth called ""furoshiki"" to encourage actual observation. Additionally, you can also redeem it for a cleaning cloth that excels in digital scenes. Please check the details on a separate page.Artwork Description:This project represents the ancient fabric's design alongside modern printed patterns using the noise() function based on xy-coordinates. The pattern is determined by the seed. The seed is determined by fxrandminter(), an original of minter. As for the colors, the design is based on a combination of two colors essential for cognitive distinction, with slight gradient variations to express cognitive differences. You can choose from a palette of 21 colors. For this project, the param feature allows you to select your favorite colors and designs. Other parameters subtly alter the texture.

Ordo is structured and controlling. Ordo tries to take Chaos and wrap it up in a box with a bow. It tries to control the uncontrollable.That is the basis of thought when I started building Ordo versus Chaos. The chaotic structures are based on waveforms and gradients. Some waves are smooth, while others are jagged and saw-like. The chaotic systems unapologetically destroy elements written to the canvas before them. They will sway in a seemingly soft wave and suddenly change directions. Overlapping waves can leave moiré patterns behind as it travels along.The Ordo comes from trying to contain the Chaos in repeating patterns. Chaos’s diagonal, vertical, and horizontal sections are mirrored to include the waveforms in a specific area. Chaos is still destructive, but it’s contained and orderly.Ordo versus Chaos is built with p5.js with the help of (fx)lens to test variations.

""Color Ballet"" is my exploration into this fascinating crossroads. It's a digital canvas that comes alive with a symphony of colors, each pixel dancing and colliding in a ballet choreographed by algorithms and randomness.Creating ""Color Ballet"" was a journey into the unknown. I started with a simple question: How can I use code to mimic the randomness and beauty inherent in nature? The answer was a digital reimagination of pointillism, a technique pioneered by Georges Seurat. But instead of painstakingly placing each dot, I let the code scale down the dots from larger to smaller sizes, creating a blend of colors as the dots moved and overlapped.The heart of ""Color Ballet"" is a simple random walk algorithm. Each pixel, or 'walker', is assigned a color and set loose on the canvas.The performance lasts for 20 seconds, after which the code stops, freezing the ballet of colors in a unique pattern.

The program randomly selects a creature and then makes its iterations follow the path of two contiguous spiral paths.

◉◉◉,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/98,working,"""◉◉◉"" presents a collection of pointillistic drawings generated by p5js. However, the work deviates from the traditional method as employed by Georges Seurat; rather than placing the smallest units of dots, the process involves scaling down the dots from larger to smaller sizes. As a result, finer details are progressively drawn, creating a visual blend of colors as the dots overlap.""◉◉◉"" project is an exploration of pixels and dots in the computer, but also of painting itself.The technique is an application of a simple random walk algorithm. Walkers, each designated with a color, traverse the canvas. The overlapping and colliding footprints of these walkers instigate a color-on-color confrontation, eventually creating distinguishable ground and figures. This process elicits the illusion of a visual object, exposing the viewer's cognitive processes and continuously reenacting the site of image formation.In fact, I have painted such an abstract on a physical canvas before, and the way the p5js develops the sensation of brushstrokes and color combinations does not seem very different from the sensation of the paintbrush and canvas at that time.Much like Damien Hirst's Spot Paintings, the multi-layered dots eventually settle at regular intervals after a specific number of iterations. The smallest dots, resembling the texture of a canvas, along with the added motion of the dots, akin to dripping paint, bestow the work with a more painterly flavor.This piece serves as both a token of gratitude for my existing collectors and a technical demonstration of my craft.2400 × 2400 pxp5js2023 Julyhasaqui",

It's like a grand dance, where tiny particles pirouette and twirl, not to music, but to the rhythm of an algorithm. Each particle is like a wanderer, setting off on a journey across the vast canvas of the screen, their path guided by the whimsical tune of something called Perlin noise.This noise, a curious mix of randomness and pattern, is the maestro of this dance. It sets the stage, and the particles move in response, their paths shifting and flowing like the sands in a desert mirage. Invisible currents, known as vectors, guide them, changing subtly with each passing moment, like a gentle breeze altering the course of a leaf floating in the wind.The particles, like explorers in an unknown land, follow these currents, creating intricate patterns that dance across the canvas. But this spectacle is as fleeting as it is beautiful. After just five seconds, the dance ends. The particles freeze in place, and the mirage becomes a still image, a snapshot of their journey.The trails left behind by the particles form a complex tapestry, a testament to their brief but vibrant dance. And that's the magic of ""Lost in Mirage"".

Once and Once Again,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/once-and-once-again,working,"I learned it from the old man, in front of the old wooden house in the dilapidated country in the North. There are not many such villages left in the North, for the others have disappeared little by little. The people there never knew the village existed, and of course they do not remember when it disappeared, and if they return to the place, they leave only the ruins. No one will return to the site, though, because it never existed, and future archaeologists may celebrate their nothfulness by building campfires and holding a silent party to the long sound of the erhu. The village was not yet up to that time, and people in thick coats swayed along the paths between the courtyards. All along the way, people are familiar to each other. Their wrinkled faces smiled without squeezing, and they nodded their heads slowly, which made no sense. Nothing here made any sense. But to outsiders, it seemed like a high-five to celebrate their friend's passing through the disaster, or a show off. The lorry driver smoked two or three cigarettes at the edge of the village and collected his load for the day. Wrinkles and paper money were mixed into the farmer's wide hands, which squeaked like dead wood as they clenched.Before 5 p.m., as the sun sets over the village, the women spill the dirty water from their dinner into the backyard gardens and exchange greetings across the path, while the men walk home together from the cabbage fields. If you are a hungry old black dog, when you lie on your stomach, you will see the old man in the middle of the slow steps, his hands in the sleeves, never taken out, sitting on the doorframe, his body swaying slowly with the trunk of the old sophora tree in front of the door, the doorframe and the whole old house made a sigh like the old tree creak. You can't tell which will die first, you or him. The thin face was wrinkled like the rings of an old tree; the beard around the mouth, though trimmed, was as tangled as a cliff-side vine; the cheekbones were like gravel; the ridges on the forehead were like the clouds before a storm, folded and thickly enfolded with weariness. The only evidence of life was the eyes under the sinkhole, which, even when hidden in the narrow gap, shone uncomfortably through the whiteness. In his youth, he was probably the brightest eye in the village.The old black dog was his companion, and when he came back to the village tired from his long journey, the old dog had just been born, and had been left in a corner, limping like a vine through a crevices in the earth. Through the dilapidated courtyards, he found the old house where he had played as a boy, now empty, so dilapidated that there was not even a skeleton to be found, and he had spent three years repairing it, three years as short as a moment in this village count in century, just long enough to repair it against the wind and rain, and the candlelight shivering in the night. His savings from years of travel have saved him from daily labor, and there is little worth spending in this village where locates on the edge of memory, where everything is born from earth and will return to earth.On a snowy day when the candles could not be lit, night took most of his soul, and he was so ill that he almost did not survive the winter. His beard, which had been covered with snow, was never black again, and even in summer he dared not leave his jacket. With his hand in his sleeve, he guarded the faint warmth between his hands as an old dragon guards the keys to the treasure. It was also in that spring that wrinkles, along with the vines, covered his face and the old house. He was no longer capable of hard work, but there was no hard work need to be done. One summer in the third year after his recovery, he declared victory in his battle with the disease, knowing that this was the best he could do. For the past eight years, he has been standing in front of the old house day after day, closing his eyes, shaking with the house and keeps murmuring , ""Once and once again.""",

Circadian Shifter,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/circadian-shifter,working,"""Circadian Shifter"": a p5.js sketch that employs a dynamic process that begins by drawing an array of diverse circles and arcs with varying radii across the canvas. Each element is randomly positioned to create an ever-changing, harmonious dance of shapes.The canvas then undergoes a transformation as it is divided into a grid of pixel squares and than shifting and rearranging the pixels in random patterns. Each composition is unique, defying predictability.Emulating the beauty of pen on paper, this technique brings a touch of organic imperfection, adding a tactile quality to the digital medium.",
Headwinds,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/headwinds,working,"The title Headwinds refer to a strong wind that resists forward motion.This clean, Nordic-like composition features a flattened perspective of winding staircase-like structures that were inspired by the trigonometric sculptural works of artist Anna Kruhelska and minimalist generative art by Ippsketch.The algorithm here establishes perspective through occlusion cues created by ordering the step panels within each column from the top to the center line, then from the bottom to the center line. Simple rules consistently direct shadows left or right, and small variations were made in the number of columns and height, which sometimes extend beyond the margin line. Interesting variations across iterations also result from differences in the wavelengths running from one column to the next. In some cases, the waves divide evenly by the number of steps and create highly regular patterns that span across columns. In other instances, the waves form diagonal patterns or even appear as a single wave across all of the columns.Colors were selected based on step number, with jitter, from slightly modified versions of 15 color gradients. This creates a curious effect where each individual column seems to include a single unique color, although there is a color gradient that unfolds continuously across several columns.This system was originally composed in R code, then translated to p5.js for fxhash.Verified NFT collectors can contact KV to purchase a fine art print for their unique token at vadenart.comAbout the artist: Kenny Vaden is a generative artist based in Charleston, SC.

To commemorate this personal milestone, I chose to incorporate the theme of focus into my first generative art token.Drawing inspiration from my childhood hobbies, I decided to represent the concept of focus by stacking stones on top of each other. As a child, I found joy in this activity, and it served as a metaphor for the determination and concentration required to overcome challenges.In addition to my personal connection, I also drew inspiration from the Japanese culture of zen, concentration, and focus. The overall theme of my generative art token reflects these principles, paying homage to the mindset of finding inner peace and clarity through focus and concentration.By combining my personal journey with the symbolism of stacked stones and the Japanese culture of zen, I hope to convey the importance of focus and celebrate the achievement of overcoming obstacles, especially for individuals like myself who face unique challenges in maintaining concentration.Please press ‘2’ to ‘7’ to change the resolution (max 5600 × 7000 px).Use the key ’S’ to save the output as a PNG file.",

Layers of Noise,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/layers-of-noise,working,"""Layers of Noise"" is a generative art project, a collaboration between the digitally native artist Rafael Spiff and myself, Bruta currently in my creative-coding, digital abstract-expressionism form. The project focuses on the duality of our existence, typical of Rafael's explorations, while my beloved theme of perseverance and stoicism is emitted in the visual dichotomy of humanoid forms between static/stoic and chaotic elements.As a collaborative empath you can see I have drawn from Rafael's visual style, but also I have to admit that another important influence is the pioneer of animated noise algorithms Kim Asendorf.The ""Layers of Noise"" system goes beyond the mere complexity of algorithms and focuses on the expressive use of experimentation. It uses the usual suspects - elements of Random and Perlin noise, Clifford based flow fields and some basic Math. These mathematical underpinnings are then creatively shattered using the Canvas API in unprecedented and unconventional ways, resulting in analog-like glitches and captivating deformations.Rafael's exploration of the tension between order and disorder in the human mind finds its perfect counterpart in the generative system's underlying theme of persistence and perseverance. The static humanoid shapes, meticulously crafted by Rafael, symbolize strength and determination, serving as anchors against the infinite layers of noise that pervade the artwork. This juxtaposition evokes a sense of wonder and contemplation, inviting viewers to delve into the intricate depths of the human experience.""Layers of Noise"" pushes artistic expression forward, creating a collection of animated artworks that transcend traditional notions of plotting centered generative art into the more digitally native direction of glitch and gif mediums. Each piece is a vibrant manifestation of the human spirit, capturing the beauty, complexity, and resilience inherent in our existence.*In the creation of every output are used three static prerendered assets in the form of .png digital artworks crafted by Rafael Spiff.

Study Three: Design and Forms,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/study-three:-design-and-forms,working,"Design and Form, a fundamental course at the Bauhaus, played a pivotal role in shaping the renowned art school's unique approach to design education. Founded in 1919 by architect Walter Gropius, the Bauhaus sought to bridge the gap between art and industry, promoting the idea that design should be both functional and aesthetically pleasing. The Design and Form course served as a cornerstone of this philosophy, providing students with a comprehensive understanding of the principles and techniques that underpin all forms of visual expression.At the heart of the Design and Form course was the exploration of the fundamental elements of design, such as line, shape, color, and texture. Students were encouraged to experiment with these elements through hands-on exercises, engaging in a process of discovery and self-expression. The course emphasized the importance of developing a keen sense of observation and a deep understanding of materials, enabling students to create harmonious compositions that seamlessly blended form and function.One of the distinguishing features of the Design and Form course was its interdisciplinary nature. The Bauhaus believed that design should transcend traditional boundaries, and students from various disciplines, including painting, sculpture, architecture, and crafts, came together to learn and collaborate. This interdisciplinary approach fostered a rich exchange of ideas, inspiring students to push the boundaries of their respective fields and embrace new ways of thinking. The Design and Form course at the Bauhaus laid the foundation for the school's revolutionary approach to design education, leaving an indelible mark on the world of art and design.-	Hit s for svg export-	Hit p for png exportParams for palette, form factor, mode and composition seed.Minting InstructionsStart by defining form factor, palette and mode.

Personalizable parameters include setting a chosen date and time, which will influence the audio generated. Drawing from live moon data, including the phase, illumination and zodiac sign of the moon at the given moment, Moonsong 1.0 generates a unique and personal musical composition.- Color parameters have also been exposed, allowing for a desired palette to be set. Contrasting colors work best. Play around and see what colors compel you.- Be mindful of how you input date and time. If you input the wrong pattern, you will be prompted to reset and start over.The correct patterns are:Date: YYYY/MM/DDTime: 24HH:MM- If you want to randomize colors, remember to reset the correct date and time patterns once before refreshing. If not, you will be prompted to reset and start over.This shouldn't be too big of a deal as your unique hash preserves everything for you, but it's good to keep in mind nonetheless for a more pleasant experience.- Finally, dates set before the 1800s will be readjusted to a reliable time-space. Astrology uses celestial coordinate systems to determine the positions of celestial bodies relative to the Earth. The most commonly used coordinate system in Western astrology is the tropical zodiac, which is based on the ecliptic plane and the Earth's equator. However, the reference points and coordinate systems used in astrology have changed over time. Without accurate data, it is difficult to perform precise calculations, including those related to the Earth's axis.The precession of the equinoxes is a slow shift in the orientation of Earth's axis of rotation. It causes a gradual change in the position of the equinoxes and the zodiac constellations over long periods of time. The effect of precession is taken into account in astrological calculations, but precise calculations require accurate historical data and reference points.",

About railings of highway bridges, which achieve exactly this effect when you drive towards them. Based on the new pattern, conclusions can be drawn about the original pattern.The Moiré effect is an optical effect in which a periodic grid is created by superimposing regular patterns. This grid has special structures that are not present in any of the individual patterns and vary when the method of superimposition is changed.Towns of Moiré are a colorful arrangement of lines into geometric figures that look like a city or like a collection of skyscrapers. The superimposition of the lines creates unique patterns, colors and gradients.There are over 300 handpicked colour-variations that were created in a dialogue between Serenica (AI Bot) and myself with the goal of creating expressive color combinations that contain a lot of myself.creatorbox / Towns of Moiré / (2023) real-time generative program, default size 900x 900px, Date Minted: July 2023You have some keyboard functionality:[1] change Pixel Density to 1 and restart[2] change Pixel Density to 2 for 2K High Resolution Images and restart[4] change Pixel Density to 4 for 4K High Resolution Images and restart[6] change Pixel Density to 6 for 6K High Resolution Images and restart[8] change Pixel Density to 8 for 8K High Resolution Images and restart[0] change Pixel Density to 10 for 10K High Resolution Images and restartPlease be patient the creation of hight Resolution Images with 6K or higher will take some time.Also the creation and storage of the image.[s] save an image at the current resolution.

These polygons will later be filled with hatching.Once the program has determined a certain number of groups/polygons, it will use a slightly higher threshold than the first one to connect points between the different polygons (lighter color).A third threshold comes into play, allowing the selection of points closer to the edges of the composition.

Study Two: Design and Forms,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/study-two:-design-and-forms,working,"Design and Form, a fundamental course at the Bauhaus, played a pivotal role in shaping the renowned art school's unique approach to design education. Founded in 1919 by architect Walter Gropius, the Bauhaus sought to bridge the gap between art and industry, promoting the idea that design should be both functional and aesthetically pleasing. The Design and Form course served as a cornerstone of this philosophy, providing students with a comprehensive understanding of the principles and techniques that underpin all forms of visual expression.At the heart of the Design and Form course was the exploration of the fundamental elements of design, such as line, shape, color, and texture. Students were encouraged to experiment with these elements through hands-on exercises, engaging in a process of discovery and self-expression. The course emphasized the importance of developing a keen sense of observation and a deep understanding of materials, enabling students to create harmonious compositions that seamlessly blended form and function.One of the distinguishing features of the Design and Form course was its interdisciplinary nature. The Bauhaus believed that design should transcend traditional boundaries, and students from various disciplines, including painting, sculpture, architecture, and crafts, came together to learn and collaborate. This interdisciplinary approach fostered a rich exchange of ideas, inspiring students to push the boundaries of their respective fields and embrace new ways of thinking. The Design and Form course at the Bauhaus laid the foundation for the school's revolutionary approach to design education, leaving an indelible mark on the world of art and design.This is the second study exploring different zoom factor, composition and base sequence creation.

Instead, I focused on re-animating and re-engaging with some of my unfinished soft-body physics experiments, combining them with a multi-layer boid simulation to create hundreds of moving blotches and the vortices moving through them. My hope was that this arrangement would help me to produce something slightly more unusual, with more easily controllable aesthetics. In the end, this approach also allowed me to put several important, but somewhat underused thi.ng libraries to a stress test and prove their approach is sound & scalable. The Art Of Pragmatism...Like most of my other projects on this platform, Marblemania uses a classic generative simulation system setup: First define the space, parameters, rules, conditions, events, agents, the behavioral & aesthetic framework — then allow the system to evolve over time, constantly applying all defined interactions, constraints and visualize their current state... The piece has over 100 design parameters and interrelations, defined and (painstakingly) refined over several months. Because of the number and complexity of weighted options and their interactions, fx(params) are not enabled for this piece.I hope the result is as mesmerizing to you as it's been for me! Having stared at these hypnotizing patterns, swirls and animations ten-thousands of times, I like to get lost in them and sometimes even see them with my eyes closed now...Marblemania is best experienced full-screen (unfortunately, the small static thumbnails are not super representative), but adapts to any screen resolution (even runs pretty smoothly on iPhone 11) and is responsive to touch and/or mouse clicks.Each minted variation selects 3 themes (from a set of 70) and by default cycles through them, each time deriving new semi-random color choices for each individual shape.

真夏の花火　Fireworks in Midsummer,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/fireworks-in-midsummer,working,"Following my previous work, ""初夏の旅路　Traveling in Early Summer,"" I am thrilled to present my second creation dedicated to the cherished memories of Japanese summer. This time, I aim to capture the essence of one of the most iconic elements associated with the season: fireworks, or as the Japanese call it, ""HANABI.""When one Japanese thinks of summer in Japan, HANABI is undoubtedly the first thing that comes to mind for many. Its roots can be traced back to 1733, during the Edo period, when a water festival was held along the Sumida River. In those challenging times of famine and epidemics, fireworks were launched as a poignant memorial for the departed souls. This marked the birth of the fireworks display tradition. As years passed, fireworks festivals became a widespread and beloved event, interwoven into the fabric of Japanese culture. The spectacle of fireworks aligns perfectly with the evening cooling culture that has developed in response to the sweltering summer climate. It has become a treasured symbol of the Japanese summer experience.In 2019, I had the privilege of witnessing two mesmerizing fireworks displays in Tokyo. The sheer beauty and inspiring nature of these displays left an indelible mark on my soul. However, due to the unprecedented challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, many of these cherished festivals were put on hold about 2 or 3 years. The good news is that this year, firework festivals across Japan are set to resume as scheduled, offering a glimmer of hope and excitement. Despite the sweltering summer heat, gathering with dear friends to enjoy the magnificent burst of colors and light would undoubtedly be an unforgettable experience.With this work, I aspire to evoke the same sense of wonder and joy that accompanies witnessing a firework show. I hope to illuminate your heart and mind, leaving you with beautiful memories akin to the enchantment of fireworks. Let the vibrant explosions of color and the crackling sound of fireworks transport you to a realm of pure delight, even if just for a fleeting moment.----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----Save as a Picture:Press “s”or “S” to download a PNG copy of the artwork.",

Study One: Design and Forms,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/study-one:-design-and-forms,working,"Design and Form, a fundamental course at the Bauhaus, played a pivotal role in shaping the renowned art school's unique approach to design education. Founded in 1919 by architect Walter Gropius, the Bauhaus sought to bridge the gap between art and industry, promoting the idea that design should be both functional and aesthetically pleasing. The Design and Form course served as a cornerstone of this philosophy, providing students with a comprehensive understanding of the principles and techniques that underpin all forms of visual expression.At the heart of the Design and Form course was the exploration of the fundamental elements of design, such as line, shape, color, and texture. Students were encouraged to experiment with these elements through hands-on exercises, engaging in a process of discovery and self-expression. The course emphasized the importance of developing a keen sense of observation and a deep understanding of materials, enabling students to create harmonious compositions that seamlessly blended form and function.One of the distinguishing features of the Design and Form course was its interdisciplinary nature. The Bauhaus believed that design should transcend traditional boundaries, and students from various disciplines, including painting, sculpture, architecture, and crafts, came together to learn and collaborate. This interdisciplinary approach fostered a rich exchange of ideas, inspiring students to push the boundaries of their respective fields and embrace new ways of thinking. The Design and Form course at the Bauhaus laid the foundation for the school's revolutionary approach to design education, leaving an indelible mark on the world of art and design.-	Hit s for svg export-	Hit p for png exportParams for palette, form factor, mode and composition seed Feature overrides mode to give you a rare gold or purpleMinting InstructionsWork on palette, from factor and mode first.

My intention is to highlight the difficulties faced by artists: social isolation, precariousness and existential torment.The chosen colors and strange landscapes of Ukiyo serve as a backdrop to explore the loneliness and suffering that artists can endure in their creative quest. Through this visual representation, I seek to elicit greater understanding and empathy for those who struggle silently to pursue their artistic passion despite the difficulties they face.

Metaphors, symbols, codes —the very fabric of art, religion, and society. And secondly, the aesthetics of recursion or accumulation.While many generative art projects pick buildings and landscapes as their subject, most artworks are made of particles arranged, connected and stretched to create bigger structures, to become textures or both.But there's a distinct texture that arises from mobs. And another, somewhat similar, that belongs to the accumulation and hoarding of not-same-objects or shapes.I can't tell if it's a street grid, a collage, a group of shrines or actual cells, but to scratch all these potential meanings using accumulation, hoarding and mobs, is what brought the texture I was looking for.What happens when a flower has more petals than pixels?

evanescence,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/evanescence-1,working,"Evanescence refers to the quality or state of being fleeting, transitory, or ephemeral. It describes something that is characterized by its tendency to disappear, fade away, or vanish quickly. The term is often used in a metaphorical sense to describe intangible things such as emotions, memories, or sensations that are temporary and elusive in nature. It can also be associated with the concept of impermanence, emphasizing the transient and impermanent nature of existence.In Japanese, there is a similar term 'Hakanasa' (儚さ) which also includes nuances of fragility and nostalgia as well. While the English word 'evanescence' may not be very commonly used, this concept is frequently heard in Japanese and holds a subtle yet deeply rooted place in the Japanese psyche, and what is interesting is the fact that the Japanese find beauty in what is evanescent.I had a conversation with a friend visiting Japan while we were going around seeing cherry blossoms about this idea of seeing or finding the beauty in, even appreciating, what is evanescent, and this work has been on my mind since then and I'm happy I am finally able to get it out there.It is animated, but the changes are gradual and it takes some time to reach what will be displayed as the final output.

Vezels,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/vezels,working,"Vezels is a generative art algorithm that explores realistic color mixing. In this project, the canvas is treated as a wet painting where each new paint layer brings forth new colors. The algorithm starts with a color palette of three hues, along with black and white. It then creates overlapping and intertwining shapes, offering opportunities for new color blends. The output reminded me of the threads of a rope, either coming together or unraveling. Hence the name ‘Vezels’, the Dutch word for ‘Fibers’.I used the 'spectral.js' library to create realistic color mixing, which I combined with a shader to improve performance. As a way of showing gratitude, 10% percent of the proceeds from each minted edition on primary will go to Ronald van Wijnen, the creator of 'spectral.js'**Exporting**You can add ‘&resolution=[integer]’ to the url to obtain a higher resolution render.

Respecting Worlds,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/respecting-worlds,working,"A man stands before a mesmerizing futuristic cityscape. The city is adorned with towering skyscrapers, reaching high into the sky, showcasing a remarkable blend of architectural marvels. The cityscape is framed by a transparent glass wall, allowing the man to observe this captivating scene with a sense of detachment.As the man gazes at the city, his attention is drawn to the sky above. Distant clouds drift languidly, creating an atmosphere of calm and tranquility. However, intermingled with the clouds, there is a subtle presence of electromagnetic radiations. These radiant beams originate from a far-off star, infusing the scene with a hint of otherworldliness and a reminder of the vastness of the cosmos.The artwork embraces a stylized and essential aesthetic, focusing on key elements that convey a sense of harmony and discord. The sleek and towering skyscrapers represent human ingenuity and progress, while the glass wall symbolizes a barrier separating the man from the urban landscape, evoking feelings of isolation and detachment.The central message of the artwork lies in the delicate balance between nature and human advancement. The distant clouds and electromagnetic radiations symbolize the sublime beauty of the natural world, while the man's presence and the futuristic cityscape highlight humanity's relentless pursuit of technological development.The artwork prompts viewers to reflect on the need for respecting and preserving nature, not just on Earth but also on any potential rescue planets we may seek in the future. It serves as a reminder that even as we explore new frontiers and expand our horizons, we must remain mindful of our responsibilities towards the environment, ensuring a harmonious coexistence between human progress and the natural world.-	Hit s for svg export-	Hit p for png exportMinting InstructionsParams for palette, form factor and dark or light modeFeature for rare mode override gold or purple",

This is associated with the Monte Carlo experiment, which allows you to estimate 'Pi' with an accuracy of over 99%.[C]Quadrant 2 can center the point by clicking on it or pressing the C-key. This quadrant displays a random movement that tends to return to its starting point over time.[D]Quadrant 3 allows the experimental setup to be saved as an image by pressing the D-key or clicking on the quadrant. Here, you find statistics for a dice game, providing orientation during experiments.[G]Quadrant 4 allows you to switch to 'symmetric-view' by pressing G-key or clicking on the quadrant. Here, a Gaussian bell curve based on the generated random values is displayed.[S]By pressing the S-key, the function 'reset' is operated, starting the experiment again from the beginning.[E]The function 'new' is operated via the E-key, offering a new experiment with another 'seed'.The seed-based random number generator (srng) is the heart of my artwork, which I realized only after delving deeper into it. This random generator is deterministic and produces pseudo numbers. The function is called 'srng()', where 's' stands for 'seed', 'r' for 'random', 'n' for 'number', and 'g' for 'generator'. The functions of the random generator are explained in the program script! 'srng()' can be easily controlled with useful instructions. [The manual is written in the JavaScript script. Search for 'var do_manual = false' and set it to 'true' so you will get an introduction.]What appears as art are test oscilloscopes for my random generator, with each quadrant housing an analysis oscilloscope. The oscilloscopes (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) have helped me to better understand what my algorithm was doing, improve it, and uncover program errors. When the process is initiated and all oscilloscopes are functioning, their sight can evoke artistic inspiration. The composition of technical necessity, the realization of an idea, and the visual interplay can be regarded as art.Quadrant 1 embodies the Monte Carlo experiment, which can be toggled between full-circle and quarter-circle. This experiment provides insights into the quality of distribution generated by my random generator.Quadrant 2 exhibits a ""drunken"" movement style that drifts but eventually returns to its starting point. It wanders aimlessly around, as a random movement should. Quadrant 3 provides helpful orientation during the experiments with a dice game and dice ranking. It indicates the probability of occurrence, aiding in making sense of the experiment. Quadrant 4 presents a Gaussian bell curve based on the generated random values. This oscilloscope often immediately showed me significant errors in my development work and emphasized the importance of symmetry.Finally, I have developed this ""Seed Random Number Generator"" for my art but also to share it with others.

The same is also echoed in the principle of emergence in cellular automata, where complex systems arise from the interactions of simple components governed by rules. This series, Sol, is a homage to LeWitt's ingenuity in favoring dispassionate geometric forms over the emotionally-infused abstract art styles.Implemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.Press p to save a png of the image in full screen.

Each artwork in the collection is composed of a series of basic modules, or 'monads', that are combined and transformed through an algorithmic process to generate a unique generative artwork.In philosophy, the term 'monad' was used by the German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz to describe the basic and indivisible unit of reality. In generative art, the term 'monad' refers to the simple elements that are combined and transformed through algorithmic processes to create artworks.Pioneers of generative art, such as Vera Molnar, Michael Noll, and John Whitney, experimented with the use of algorithms to generate artworks. These artists developed computer programs and mechanical systems that used simple patterns and shapes to create complex and dynamic artworks. In this context, 'monads' became the fundamental building blocks of these generative artworks.In the Monad 1960 collection, programming and algorithmic design are used to generate unique artworks that reflect the principles of the generative art movement.

The colors and forms presented evoke the sensation of being in a tropical garden, with its vibrant flowers and exotic foliage.The region in which we reside provides us with the opportunity to contemplate the majesty of nature from our windows. The whimsical shapes and vibrant colors displayed in our flora have been a constant source of inspiration for us since our childhood. Memories of exploring the forest, building treehouses, or simply climbing trees, always accompanied by a touch of imagination and fantasy. It is precisely this combination of tropical beauty and the magic of crystals that we wanted to convey in our artwork.To develop this piece, I had the fortune of being accompanied by two great individuals: the talented clauilustrada, who brought each component of the artwork to life, and the engineer hectikin.dev, who supported me in the monumental task of creating the code for this work. This project has been an exciting and rewarding challenge, as it has allowed us to merge our passion for technology with our deep respect for nature.This work takes elements of inspiration from the works of Zancan, Nat Sarkissian, and Mjlindow, authors whom we respect and admire for their masterful works. However, we do not attempt in any way to reproduce their style or components. All the elements that shape our work were designed by Clauilustrada.Furthermore, the code has been meticulously crafted by Hectikin.dev and RosbelDev, employing a 100% original approach without resorting to pre-rendering techniques or image compositions in order to accomplish the ultimate outcome.To download the image press ( s ), be patient.We hope you like it",

Circle or Square?,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/circle-or-square,working,"This is an Optical Art piece that lets your mind oscillate between seeing circles, squares or circles in squares. In some configurations it is obvious, in others that's a little more tricky.The key concept that underlies this generative art piece is a mathematical algorithm that allows me to change a square array of dots into a circular arrangement. This is called circling a square.The overall image is a regular 4 x 3 tessellation of ""tiles"" consisting of either circled or un-circled variations of a tile. Before I draw the image, I make three decisions. One, the choice which tile to use. Two, whether to shade the dots within a tile from the inside-out or the outside-in. And three, the background coloring. For the background color I chose either a uniform random color or one of four orientations of a linear gradient with its own random parameters.In one version of a tile the positions of the dots are translated into a circle by the algorithm in the other version they are not translated. In both versions I scale the dots relative to their positions in the array that scale factor also determines their color, a shade of gray ranging from black to white. It is possible for any iteration of this program to produce some crazy Gestalt effects. Enjoy.Please visit www.drbillkolomyjec.com",

Each rectangle has a number of sockets distributed evenly along it's edges, these sockets can then be connected at random, without intersecting each other. Based on these connections we can then identify different polygonal regions with a contour walking approach. The rectangles are then split into these polygonal regions. That is the essence of this generative piece.The Parameters:1. This token is tied to the minter address - WYSIWYG - randomness is therefore derived off of that address.

Is the square opposite flat or a cube? What is the ""situation"" between the objects? I also enjoy using the systems of abstract images. One such great master who created marvelous systems was Imre Bak. He served as an inspiration for this series, which I created as a tribute to his genius.Three compositions were finalized - envision it as if a painter had crafted a series. In all three compositions, the image is composed of objects pyramids and cuboids.WindowWhile working on this piece, I received an invitation to the Proof of X exhibition. During the creative process, an unintentional appearance of the X manifested in one of the compositions. I interpreted it as a subtle reference to Proof of X. This composition, which I consider the first in the series, features an opening window that symbolizes the opportunity extended to me by the exhibition organizers, an honor I deeply appreciate.SituationsThe second composition shows the effect of the objects on each other based on their position and movements relative to each other. Some objects seem to ""dance"" around each other, while others appear to interact or merge into a singular entity.TravellersAmong the three, this particular composition evokes the most profound emotions within me. It captures the essence of ""arrival"" and ""departure,"" along with the passage of time that lies between the two.In all three compositions, I contemplate the relationships between individuals - even though I never had the privilege of knowing Imre Bak personally - I believe that we were able to ""establish a dialogue"" through art.No need for noiseIn the series, the clean visual world evokes a sense of tranquility and silence.

初夏の旅路 Traveling in Early Summer,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/traveling-in-early-summer,working,"""初夏の旅路 Traveling in Early Summer""is part of the interactive minting experience at Proof of X with KUMALEON, Tokyo, 2023.----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----Concept:As the rainy days came to an end, the gentle fall of cherry blossoms marked the arrival of early summer. This transitional phase between spring and summer brings a mild and pleasant climate. Nature awakens, showcasing vibrant shades of green as plants thrive and flourish. A stroll through the streets of Tokyo reveals a captivating sight: hydrangeas of various colors grace every corner, casting a spell of natural beauty. While the occasional typhoon may pass by, it does not overshadow the charm of this season. Moreover, the ripening plums offer a taste of traditional Japanese flavors, with options ranging from sour plums to plum wine.My inspiration for this piece draws upon my own impressions of early summer in Japan. In 2019, having recently arrived in Japan, I embarked on a journey to Kamakura with my friends. The vivid hydrangeas and serene ponds at Hasedera Temple left an indelible mark on my memory as my first encounter with the essence of early summer in Japan. It was during that year that I delved into the realm of creative coding, by using Processing. The following year, in 2020, I ventured further into generative art using P5.js. Both my pursuit of knowledge in Japan and my creative endeavors became integral parts of my life's journey, akin to cherished scenic spots that leave a lasting impression. Through my artwork, I aspire to share my sentiments from this transformative voyage with the audience.----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----Now, let's delve into the details of my creation. The objective of this artwork was to portray a top-down perspective of a pond encircled by lush vegetation, reminiscent of a landscape painting. To imbue the work with different atmospheres, I incorporated four distinct styles for the plant elements: grass, leaves, pine needles, and bubbles. The interplay of these elements breathes life into the still scene, infusing the entire artwork with vitality. The rippling water and gracefully swimming koi in the pond evoke a sense of movement, juxtaposing the serene setting. In Eastern culture, koi symbolizes wealth, auspiciousness, health, and happiness. It bestows good fortune upon those who encounter it. Ultimately, my artwork encapsulates my initial impression of early summer in Japan through a creative approach that intertwines reality and imagination, merging motion and stillness.Through this artistic endeavor, I aim to transport the audience to the captivating realm of early summer in Japan. With its vibrant colors, gentle breezes, and the promise of new beginnings, this season captures the essence of natural beauty and the richness of Japanese culture. May my work resonate with viewers, allowing them to embark on their own journey through the enchanting landscapes of their imagination.----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----Save as a Picture:Press “s”or “S” to download a PNG copy of the artwork.",

It started as a collection of black and white contour map style noise. I had not yet found X from this simple noise. I turned the particles into lines and rotated them based on the noise. This rotation was the beginning of everything. A flow field was created there. However, I had not yet found X from the monotone flow field then. Next, I added color along the noise. Blue and green flow field reminded me of water and plants, and red and yellow reminded me of  trees with autumn leaves.  White also evoked snow and brown reminded me of deciduous trees. Several landscapes were created. However, no satisfactory X was found from the colored flow field. By intuitively rearranging them, I came to associate them with the changing seasons. Through finding order in the noise, I found the first parameter ""the cycle"". It's sequence of the seasons. Based on this parameter, I decided to explore the X . I set the cycle to 12. I found something that repeats over a cycle of one year. It is the orbit of the earth. The earth revolves both on its own axis and around the sun. However, there is something missing for cycle of the seasons to occur. What was missing was the earth's axis. It produce beautiful noise which harmonize with each other on the ground. ""X ≒ 23.4 : the axis of the earth"" , this is what I discovered ""X"" through this work!!What I mean through this series of association game is as follows. I used a lot of formulas in my code. But the main tools I used to get from the initial simple black and white noise to the ""X"" were sensitivity, analogy, and creativity. Being able to discover artistic values about the fluctuations caused by randomness and noise is a precious gift given to human beings. I believe it is the fundamental force that advances and enriches human beings, like discovering gravity from an apple falling. And I believe that one of the possibilities of generative art is the ability to gain new awareness and new creativity from unexpected results through repeated trial and error. I did not start out trying to recreate nature.

As a result, iron bars were installed outside windows, giving the appearance of prison cells (of course, there are also other more complex or fundamental reasons). However, Taiwan does have beautiful iron window grates. Skilled craftsmen used to handcraft these grates, and each piece resembled a work of art.

The richness of colors, a defining element of this artwork, plays a vital role, ranging from vibrant, intense hues to subtle pastels, creating a spectacular mosaic of colors. This explosion of colors gives the work energy and dynamism, attracting the eye and stimulating the senses.Densely arranged lights move along predetermined paths, enveloping the viewer in a visual experience that beckons contemplation of immersion within ethereal spaces. ""Re.flex.ions"" evokes an introspective atmosphere, encouraging exploration of emotions and a physical connection with the abstract image.Abstract art generates images and associations that rely on subtle reference points, such as contextual relationships, object interactions, and physical scale. Project responsiveness serves as a foundation for establishing these reference points. The resulting images recall both cosmic and microscopic visions. They are organic on one hand and mechanical in their movement on the other.The perception of ""re.flex.ions"" varies depending on the device. Factors such as the image's context, size, and relationship to our physical body influence the interpretation. Smaller devices often evoke micro-scale associations, while larger screens transport observers into an indeterminate cosmic abyss. When projected onto traditional CRT monitors, the artwork assumes the aura of a laboratory experiment observed from a safe distance, as if through glass or the lens of an operator's camera. Immersion replaces mere spectatorship, fostering an experiential engagement.In reference to responsiveness, ""re.flex.ions"" adapts to the aspect ratio of the display, but also enables interaction based on the position of a mobile device.

I add a bit of displacement to the center of each tile to conceal the regular placement of each tile in the grid. The phyllo seeds (round dots) vary in size and ""tightness,"" for each blossom drawn. I add randomness to the phyllo spiral by varying the dot intervals a bit, as well as give a random range to the dot size. The background color is an RGB color for a night sky.

Metamorphosis,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/metamorphosis-3,working,"This project uses cellular automata where the state of a cell in a new generation is determined based on its own and its neighbors' states in the previous generation. The guiding rules for these transitions, however, are not static; they undergo a random change every few generations, chosen from a possible 256 rules. By also slightly shifting the positions of cells and using an outline and texture that conveys a hand-drawn style, I have tried introducing an element of organic randomness.Stepping away from the monochromatic color scheme used in my last three series, I have used a gradient effect to convey a transitioning hue across generations, combining a palette of two colors selected from an array of 14 different palettes. Note on the name: The alternating rules and fluctuating cell positions serve as the apparent justification for its name. However, a subtler inspiration lies in my deep admiration for Franz Kafka and his remarkable short story, ""The Metamorphosis"". Kafka’s narrative explores the constantly evolving state of human existence, where patterns appear momentarily only to dissipate quickly. Just when you think you've spotted a pattern, poof, it changes.

Slice of Life,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/slice-of-life,working,"""Slice of Life"" is a part of the live minting experience at Non Fungible Conference Lisbon, June 7-8, 2023. It is a generative art series about seeing beauty in the ordinary, inspired by tree rings and the stories they hold.When I first learned of tree rings as a kid, I thought that a tree meticulously recorded its own life story, similar to how my parents marked my height with dates on the wall behind our kitchen door. Next to each date, there was a small description, some were milestones but most were mundane. We’ve moved across an ocean since then, but tree rings always remind me of my first home, of how my parents cherished and celebrated the small things in life.Initially I created figurative paintings of tree rings, however they felt a bit too still and lonesome, and lacked the warmth I wanted to convey. Then it dawned on me that while each tree stands on its own, our lives are intertwined with one another. These connections and interactions play a big role in shaping who we are, as well as our sense of home and belonging. From there on the artwork evolved to be messier, more expressive, and more like a slice of life as I see it.Created by Elsif, 2023.06FX paramsThis artwork uses the minter address along with a selectable seed to enable personalization.I recommend locking the other params and cycling through the 42 seeds to find your favorite.The palette and initial position of pigments are entirely determined by the seed.

We are replacing what is pure and beautiful with soulless illusions slipped into our hands in exchange for what makes us human...Yet we still keep trying to reach what we've been intentionally and continuously driving away from us. What we fool ourselves as to be touchable any time we want, is getting more and more unreachable in reality.

With every line of its code, with every brush of its color, it helped me take one step further to leave that hardship behind.I painted Onåbar using only rectangles, with a long-evolved version of an algorithm I first experimented in my TI·ME series. The mostly colorful nature of Onåbar's palettes come from my replenished hope for reaching the unreachable.The more I worked on Onåbar, the more it helped me realize that what seems to be unreachable, in any aspect of life, only seems so because we do everything to keep it stay unreachable, instead of taking the necessary steps towards reaching it.

Quantum ATLAS,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/quantum-atlas,working,"Quantum ATLASThis artwork was inspired by high-energy physics — the branch of physics that deals with the study of the fundamental particles and forces that make up the universe. It seeks to understand the structure and behavior of matter at the smallest scales, exploring the most fundamental building blocks of nature and the interactions between them.High-energy physics investigates fundamental particles, such as quarks, leptons, and bosons, which are the building blocks of atoms and matter as we know it. It aims to answer questions about their properties, masses, charges, and the forces that govern their interactions. This field of study relies on powerful particle accelerators, such as the Large Hadron Collider, to create high-energy collisions between particles and observe the resulting reactions.Detectors play a crucial role in high-energy physics experiments. They are sophisticated instruments designed to detect, measure, and analyze the particles and their properties that are produced during high-energy collisions in particle accelerators. Detectors enable scientists to collect data and gain insights into the fundamental particles and forces that govern the universeThe ATLAS detector is a large particle detector, one of the four main detectors at the Large Hadron Collider. ATLAS stands for ""A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS"" and is designed to investigate various aspects of particle physics, including the search for new particles, the study of the Higgs boson, and the exploration of fundamental forces and particles. The detector is massive in size, measuring about 46 meters in length and 25 meters in height.By analyzing the vast amount of data produced by the collisions, scientists can gain insights into the fundamental nature of matter, unravel the mysteries of the universe, and potentially make groundbreaking discoveries that contribute to our understanding of the fundamental laws of physics.Quantum ATLAS is my artistic endeavor that seeks to emulate the infinite variety of forms that elementary particles can exhibit during collisions within detectors. From elegant spirals and swirling vortexes to branching networks and pulsating clusters, it unveils a visual tapestry of shapes and structures that echo the fundamental processes occurring at the quantum level. The intricate lines in the artwork simulate the paths of particles as they traverse the detector, leaving behind traces of their presence.Please use fullscreen or download artwork in high resolution for a better viewing experience.

Limits of Calligraphy,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/limits-of-calligraphy,working,"The concept of Ambiguity of Limits is based on Zeno's Paradox, which states that you can never reach your destination if you keep halving the distance between you and your destination. In this image, a single tile is placed in the center of a picture frame. Around the perimeter of the tile, an algorithm is used to draw a contiguous ring of half-size versions of the tile. This process is repeated eight times, until the tile size is smaller than a pixel. If the algorithm were to run indefinitely, it would never reach the outer edge of the picture frame. This is because the distance between the tile and the edge of the picture frame is constantly being halved, and as the tile size approaches zero, the distance between the tile and the edge of the picture frame approaches infinity.The central tile in the image consists of an algorithmic stroke. This stroke is similar to a hand-drawn pen stroke in a calligraphic exercise. It is created by joining two randomly chosen adjacent corners of the tile with a crescent-shaped area formed by two Bézier curves.The Ambiguity of Limits is a fascinating concept that demonstrates the power of mathematics. It shows that even though something may seem impossible, it can still be possible if we use the right tools. In this case, the right tool is mathematics.Please visit www.drbillkolomyjec.com",

Emergent Spaces,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/emergent-spaces,working,"""Emergent Spaces"" is a collaboration between Paolo Bianchini and Chris Coleman, digital artists.Living organisms are made of billions of cells, working in concert and creating emergent forms. The result of 3D scanning is to turn the surface of these forms into millions of data points, each with a position and color. Linking these digital points randomly can create entirely new forms, impossible in real space. This form is a story, constructed from a moment in time and a transaction. At the core of the data points are scans of many different bouquets of flowers, all now dead and decaying in a landfill. These artworks will be something new from that beautiful moment, blooming on the blockchain.The project uses five 3d scan data sets, each distilled from a photogrammetry point cloud. Hundreds of photos were taken of each group of flowers and processed using MetaShape. The resulting point clouds are exported as vertices with xyz positions and rgb colors. The millions of points making up each scan were then randomly reduced to 50,000 points, capturing the form and coloring from the original plants. The scattered geometry also draws positions and colors from this dataset, further exploring the digital remains.10% of initial sales are going to support the P5.js project, which was used in this project.This token is part of the SESSIONS SERIES co-curated by the NFT Museum of Newberry, SC and Fort Gallery NFT.Params---------------------------------Source: Choose from one of the five 3D scan data sets.

It is the first (therefore, inaugural) Generative Art Motion Graphic produced by Dr. Bill Kolomyjec in collaboration with Christopher Scussel. Blob Swirls begin as my challenge to Chris to write an algorithm that produces fluid motion graphical objects similar to the blobs in a lava lamp that we could animate. After many undesirable iterations and after a few months of effort we had a working candidate. Then it was my task to do something with it.A set of 5 blobs are distributed equally around a circle and set off to follow that circular path as the radii that positions them moves in and out constrained by a sinusoidal function. When they reach an arbitrary limit, they reverse course returning to their initial starting positions and so on. The limit could be forever, but it is of sufficient length. It is an aesthetic decision make them flow back and forth.The more challenging part was the fluidity of the blobs. Chris came up with the cleaver scheme of moving the closed, seemingly elastic blob shapes over a randomly defined mathematical terrain. The blobs stay closed and appear to flow around the surface below. A new set of blobs are generated every time the browser is refreshed. The other built-in interactions are based on keypresses:up arrow - increase speeddown arrow - decrease speedleft arrow - stop/pauseright arrow - start/playA - asymmetrical modeS - symmetrical mode  <<<defaultany other key - reverse directionTwo modes: asymmetrical and symmetrical modes are evoked by pressing the A and S key respectively.

Simple Fail,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/simple-fail,working,"===== A Simple Fail =====An attempt to release a quick follow-up to Adherence following simple rules and a concise set of features has utterly failed!  I ended up spending 9 months of development on this ""quick"" project; I didn't even spend that much time on Adherence.  What happened?  First, and foremost, I had no intention to ever release a project that I wouldn't be absolutely excited about if I were to see in the Incoming feed as a collector.  Nothing wrong with that, right!?  But, not all factors that delayed this project were so noble.  I have to admit that as I continued to stack features and techniques, my codebase, once again, has gotten away from me.  I'm not too worried about how poor my code will look to lurkers (although, God help them!).  But, poor code, without question, hampers the ability for a developer to iterate.  Each shortcut a developer takes lays traps along paths that will eventually be revisited and I took A LOT of shortcuts in my excitement of each new idea.Appropriately, my failures are fully in keeping with the project itself.  A Simple Fail explores a favorite generative theme of human imperfection through the construction of each mints foundational grid to the ""inaccuracy"" of draw styles that fill each shape.  <Read more about A Simple Fail:@ https://www.bfos.art/projects/a-simple-fail @ https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/a-simple-fail>==== fx(params) Info ====WARNING: 1-Day Grace Period!There is only a 24 hour grace period before mint tickets will need to be protected with the params tax.  Why?  Because there is currently no way to trade mint tickets during the grace period.  If you don't mint your ticket immediately, I STRONGLY suggest that you immediately update the price and tax coverage on your mint ticket.  This should only matter in the fortuitous case of a sell out, but I wanted to make sure this was communicated clearly just in case!I had initially decided to not include params in this project at all.  I think params are great, but most projects released with params so far have suffered because of them, in my opinion.  Params often detract from the artist's efforts to craft the feature-probability space and tuning of the project.  I put a lot of effort into that in this project and I didn't want to see collectors struggle to replicate what I've already crafted.  That said, I loved the restrained way Tyler Boswell (@teaboswell) implemented params in Reunion to give collectors a limited ability to choose their mints.  I thought 25 seeds per wallet was a little on the light side.  So, I have doubled that to 50 potential mints a wallet can choose from.  I have also configured an option to mint a completely random mint in the traditional style.  The features in your mint might include a complementary tip of the hat to your faithfulness for being so bold!

In the series, lines and circles are used in an organics movement like Cloud Hands, which is a move of Tai Chi. Practitioners move their hands slowly and smoothly, make circles and rotate with extreme concentrating. In Chinese we said “floating clouds and flowing water” to describe calligraphers’ freely flowing style of writing. Chi is a very important for oriental artists, and for genart as well. In the series, lines and circles start from one position to another, and develop with organic rotations and movements, like practicing Tai Chi on the canvas. Mythologic was inspired from “Classic of Mountains and Seas”, also known as Shan Hai Jing, is a Chinese classic text and a compilation of mythic geography and beasts. “There is a beast that looks like a fox with nine tails.” “Huangbei: it is a beetle with meat like a tadpole, but with a head and a tail” “The beast has the body of a fish but the wings of a bird” There are many incredible creatures in the text which describe the oriental fantasy. The idea of Mythologic is to present an illustrated handbook with random generated paintings, each one is like a framed badge, to memorize the glorious age. It uses the ""cloud hands"" technique in every parts of this piece, the center, the circle and the frame. They are all the same algorithm but perform variety with different density and components.

Tapawingo,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/tapawingo,working,"Tapawingo employs a fundamental structure, essentially an isometric grid, which is constructed row by row and simultaneously rotated around a specific point. Remarkably, such a simple configuration can yield incredibly diverse, abstract results that are unique in their variation.The resultant outputs can undergo radical changes in the final moments, frequently leading to entirely unanticipated end products. A significant level of randomness, coupled with a multitude of variables, have been seamlessly incorporated into this project, all within a remarkably straightforward framework. This truly empowers the algorithm to generate creations beyond our wildest imaginations. The code contains minimal curation, which occasionally leads to less-than-ideal outcomes. For instance, at times, the color scheme and rotation might converge in a way that leaves the canvas predominantly empty.

Blockchain Automaton,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/blockchain-automaton,working,"This experimental project involves an on-chain cellular automaton. The features and cellular automaton rules are derived from the minter's address. Being the first (unto my knowledge) project on fxhash that generates the artwork completely on chain, it seemed fitting to draw inspiration from one of the first projects on fxhash, ""RGB Elementary Cellular Automaton"".What is this?An experimental generative token that integrates on-chain generation, and on-chain storage of the artwork. This is accomplished using a custom smart contract. The artwork is generated using the generate_on_chain entrypoint in KT1GRFujk5m6feK7gJcqCU7ijJkFgx5JigEt, and the generated image is subsequently stored on-chain as a byte-string of pixels (row-major order) in the tokens bigmap in KT1GRFujk5m6feK7gJcqCU7ijJkFgx5JigEt.How does this work?Smart contracts have a default entrypoint which is automatically called when XTZ is sent to the contract. By using a smart contract as the primary address, the default entrypoint will be called every time a token is minted. Of course, to prevent accounts from bypassing the fxhash contracts and sending XTZ directly to the smart contract, generating and storing the artwork on-chain, the smart contract checks that an fxhash contract is the account sending XTZ. In this smart contract, the default entrypoint immediately calls the generate_on_chain entrypoint for the sole purpose of making the generation process more apparent on indexers like tzkt.In order to make this project compatible with fxhash, the artwork produced by the code submitted to fxhash must be identical to that which is produced by the generative algorithm within the smart contract. At the time of development, the minter's address is the only piece of information which is readily accessible via the fxhash snippet API and in the smart contract. As a result, each account can only generate a single unique artwork (this is enforced by the contract). In the future, this issue could be solved if the fxhash snippet API provided access to the iteration number, as the smart contract could also keep track of this information quite easily.Consequently, collectors who wish to collect more than one iteration must create additional accounts to mint. The tokens can then be subsequently transferred as per usual.Why is the variations preview disabled?Because the minter's address is the source of randomness for the generated artwork, not the hash provided by fxhash, changing the hash in the variations preview will have no effect. To see different variations of the artwork you need to modify the fxminter URL parameter in live preview mode.Why does the mint button not work on the fxhash frontend?Currently, the fxhash frontend has a default storage limit for mint operations that is less than what is required to store the generated image on chain. As a result, the mint button will fail on the fxhash frontend. To get around this, you can mint this token on a mini-website I created (https://blockchain-automaton.netlify.app/), or on Better Call Dev, or by injecting the transaction directly onto the blockchain.But Why?Because experimentation is fun.",

The rectangular areas are filled with contiguous circles of analogous colors. I incorporated Vasarelys' trick of throwing in a random black circle 10% of the time.The color scheme is premeditated. I use a random base color (from the infamous color wheel) as a starting point for filling the circles. I also use that same base color to formulate a triad palette assigning 2 of the 3 colors to the split background areas of the picture frame.Of course, controlled randomness defines many of the random variables to promote serendipity.Please visit Dr. Bill Generative Art OG @ www.drbillkolomyjec.com",

They represent the power of words, both in their ability to unite and to divide, reflecting the complex dance of human connections. Adjacent to the lips, the heart emerges as a universal symbol of love, passion, and compassion. It signifies the profound emotions that bind individuals together, transcending boundaries and resonating deeply within our collective human experience.Amidst the intricate tapestry, symbols of homes and air balloons emerge, whispering tales of belonging and boundless explorationAmong the layers, stylized skulls peer out, evoking a contemplation of mortality and the transient nature of life. These symbols serve as a reminder of the fleeting nature of existence, urging us to appreciate each moment and embrace the richness of life's tapestry. Intertwined with the skulls, hands reach out, embodying the diverse spectrum of human actions and interactions. They represent both the tenderness of care and the power of action, illustrating the intricate dance between benevolence and strength.Amidst this intricate composition, danger signs punctuate the canvas, asserting the inherent risks and challenges inherent in the human experience. They serve as cautionary symbols, highlighting the need for awareness and resilience as we navigate the complex dance of existence.Through the juxtaposition and arrangement of these symbols, ""Dance of Existence"" weaves together a powerful visual narrative, inviting contemplation and reflection on the profound and enigmatic journey of life.

Conceptually the new version of a cylinder is like taking a book and rotating it's covers around it's spline to touch. I use a wire-frame approach, rotating a random number of slices (pages of the book) around a vertical axes. I store each cylinder as 3D coordinates in arrays and manipulate their data with scaling, rotation and perspective equations. I use a contrived multi-axis rotation scheme rather than pure randomness. I translate each cylinder into its place in the display matrix similar to the original work.The original version was black line on a white background.

Hus,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/hus,working,"Hus is a temporal generative art data visualization about care work and gender. Each variation of the work provides a unique perspective of the gender gap in care work within Danish society. Utilizing time and movement as a visualizer technique, the underlying data set is meant to be  understood by the spectator through prolonged exposure to the work. Hus changes its expression over a 24 hour cycle to visualize how care work can be understood to be split between men, women and queer people in Danish society. Each of the three main colors in Hus correspond to a different group of people. Each group has different movements, corresponding to how the data shows that they approach care work. The data comes from the report “Hvordan bruger danskerne tiden?” from 2018 by Rockwool Fonden. The report does not include data for queer people, and they are therefore included as a separate group with a somewhat random pattern of movements to emphasize the lack of representation in research.

IKKA,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/ikka,working,"Multiple influences came together in this offering. I continue playing with defining color spaces based on color theory, writing algorithms to create interesting forms of spatial organization and employing ""controlled randomness"" in a creative way.Defining a color space requires a tip of the hat to Bauhaus School faculty, specifically:  Johannes Itten, Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, and Josef Albers who formulated modern color theory. For example, Paul Klee is credited for inventing the color wheel. Which, in my opinion, evolved into the HSL color model.New spatial organization schemes (part of the theory of called the Language of Vision by Gyorg Kepes, another Bauhuas alum) are basically ways of organizing the picture plane. This seems to manifest itself in my passion for tiled surfaces. From the very beginning in wrote programs that generated tessellations.Controlled randomness or putting parameters around the output of a random number generator, can be attributed to Roger Coqart. I use randomness to add variety and interest in many of my works. I love the serendipity that can be achieved when properly employed.",

Flowers of Progress,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/flowers-of-progress,working,"This artwork is a fusion of technical mastery and emotional depth, a mesmerizing composition of countless tiny strokes that together depict a vibrant bouquet of flowers cradled in a vase. Each stroke, meticulously generated through code, is more than a pixel on a screen; it's a testament to the painstaking process of its creation and to my inner struggle.During a period of creative drought, I found myself grappling with the vast canvas of my imagination, striving to bring forth ideas that stubbornly lingered beneath the surface. The struggle to birth a new masterpiece mirrored the blank canvas before me, a formidable opponent that reflected my creative void.Emerging from this struggle is the painting itself, a testament to my evolution. Each flower, resplendent in its multi-hued glory, signifies an idea that eventually bloomed in the arid landscape of my imagination. They are not just flowers, but symbols of triumph over artistic adversity, each one born of relentless determination, countless hours, and a deep-seated resolve.The bouquet is a symphony of colors, textures, and shapes, with each tiny stroke having its own purpose, its own identity. Together, these strokes bring forth a visual effect reminiscent of Impasto Oil Painting, offering a sense of depth and volume, a tactile quality that seems to lift the flowers off the canvas. Each one was placed carefully, deliberately, with precision guided by complex algorithms and a vision of the bigger picture they were part of.The vase, a beacon of silver and gray amidst the riotous bloom, represents me. It is the vessel that contains and supports the bouquet, much like how I channel my creativity into a myriad of ideas, each one blooming into an individual stroke on the canvas.This painting serves as a reminder that the creation of something beautiful and meaningful often starts small. The blooming flowers did not appear overnight. They are the result of thousands of tiny strokes, each one placed carefully, deliberately, and with a firm belief in the bigger picture they were part of.In essence, the vase of flowers is not just a painting, but a story - my story - of struggle, perseverance, and the power of tiny, incremental steps towards a grand vision. It is a testament to the fact that great things often start small, and in the end, every stroke counts.Artist's Note:Please be aware that due to the complexity and depth of the layers of shaders involved in creating the ""Flowers of Progress"", the artwork might take a bit of time to load or may not work on some devices.

Each parameter can, of course, be explained in great detail, but in reality the best way to work with the piece is to play.The random numbers for the piece are generated using the minter's address, meaning that what you see as a live preview will be the exact mint received.",

This enchanting place was a sanctuary for beings of magic and wonder, where the extraordinary mingled with the ordinary.Megarid was known for its harmonious coexistence between humans and fantastical creatures. The townsfolk, led by the wise Mayor Eldrin, believed in nurturing unity and preserving the delicate balance between the realms. They lived in harmony with the magical beings that resided in the valleys, mountains, and the sea.The valleys surrounding Megarid were vibrant and filled with the sweet aroma of blooming flowers. Fairies fluttered about, spreading joy and casting their gentle spells to ensure prosperity for the town. The air was filled with the melodious songs of the woodland creatures, and every nook and cranny hid secrets waiting to be discovered.The mountains, majestic and awe-inspiring, stood as guardians of Megarid. Hidden within their peaks were ancient temples, where wise sorcerers sought knowledge and communed with celestial spirits. Dragons soared through the sky, their magnificent wings casting shadows over the valleys below. These noble creatures protected the land and its inhabitants with their strength and wisdom.The sea, vast and mysterious, was both a source of sustenance and an endless adventure. Merfolk, with their shimmering tails and voices that could rival the sweetest lullabies, dwelled beneath the waves. They shared their secrets of the ocean's depths with those who dared to venture beneath the surface, revealing treasures beyond imagination.Life in Megarid was filled with magical wonders. Every festival brought together townsfolk and fantastical beings in grand celebrations. The Midsummer's Eve was a particularly cherished event when the fairies danced under the moonlight, casting spells that filled the air with glittering enchantments.continue-->",

Mr. Whiskers’ Generative Synthwave Odyssey,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/mr.-whiskers'-generative-synthwave-odyssey,working,"A soundscape of synthwave music built using JS. Generates a looped sequence of notes played by a polyphonic synthesizer, with a random selection of scales and beats per minute. Features Mr.Whiskers on synth on a white canvas and one other color chosen from a palette of seven colors. The colors in the palette are variations of black or blue. The code defines several pitch sets, including major and minor scales, pentatonic scales, and whole-half diminished scales, and randomly selects one of these sets to use as the basis for the loop (total of 19 scales). The loop is generated using a 16-step grid, with each step representing an eighth note. At each step, the code randomly enables or disables cells in the grid, and if a cell is enabled, the code plays a note on the synthesizer corresponding to the pitch of that cell. The code also randomly changes the beats per minute (bpm) within a range of 120-180 bpm. This creates a sense of variation in the tempo, and combined with the randomization of the scale, can lead to an infinite number of variations. Regardless of its starting point, your distinctive version will maintain a consistent pitch set and bpm throughout._____________________________________________To interact with the artwork:- Start the music by either pressing the 'm' key or clicking anywhere on the canvas.- No sight of Mr. Whiskers?

The first twenty five steps of the CA evolution are shown sequentially in a grid, with the center cell update rules for each of the eighteen 9-neighbor configurations shown at the top.

When things get tough, we might feel like giving up or losing hope. However, it's important to remember that success is not always a straight line. There might be unexpected obstacles and setbacks that we need to overcome. By taking a step back and looking at the bigger picture, we can identify patterns and connections that can help us navigate our way towards success.Connecting the dots is all about being willing to take risks and trying new things. It's about being open to new experiences and opportunities and not being afraid to step outside of our comfort zone. This might involve trying something that seems unconventional or risky, but it could lead to unexpected paths towards success.While connecting the dots can be challenging, it's important to be patient, persistent, and willing to learn from our mistakes. It's also important to stay true to our own values and goals, as the path to success is not the same for everyone. By staying focused on our goals and remaining flexible and adaptable, we can create a fulfilling and meaningful life that is uniquely our own.In summary, connecting the dots can be a powerful strategy for achieving success, even when our path is messy and different from others.

Azulejos definitivos,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/azulejos-definitivos,working,"Inspired by the traditional Portuguese art of tilework, „Azulejos definitivos“ takes a generative approach on the original handwork. At its core, this artwork embraces simplicity and symmetry, while simultaneously allowing for endless possibilities and variations. A single tile serves as a building block, contributing to the overall composition of the larger arrangement. A basic, often repetitive, unit is arranged in a systematic manner to form intricate and visually mesmerising compositions. This principle is based on the idea that when small elements are repeated and combined in various ways, they can generate a sense of harmony, rhythm, and complexity. Moreover, through the manipulation of color, resolution, complexity, and tile size, this principle provides abundant opportunities for creating optical illusions and engaging perceptual effects. These effects can include the presence of hidden images within the pattern.---The selection of colors are derived from original tiles found on my various travels through Portugal.---Note for collectors:The artwork is not WYSIWYG. Your fx(params) configuration will set a style of the tile that will be randomised when you mint your token. Ideally the style will be recognisable upon randomisation, but be aware that certain configurations have a larger or smaller potential in variations. Make sure to test your parameters with different hashes. The parameters itself have a pretty high resolution. Sometimes small changes can have a huge impact. Instead of just moving the sliders it can also be advised to step through the inputs with the arrows keys on your keyboard.

The Paradox of Choice,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/the-paradox-of-choice,working,"### OVERVIEW ###This project revisits some of the foundational ideas in my previous work ""Above (The Infinite)"" and makes them available in a parameterized form for your exploration.This project both rewards and requires exploration. I intentionally left the parameter space very broad so that edge case configurations would be possible. In practice this means that additional curation beyond the initial random parameters will very likely be required, in a way that mimics my day to day experience as a generative artist.Thanks to Karsten Schmidt for his excellent thi.ng libraries (https://thi.ng/), which form the technical foundation upon which this work was built.### CONTROLS ###e - Save the current frame as a PNGspace - Pause/Resume animation### PARAMETERS ###NOTE: Some combinations of parameters will cause flashing/strobing, which is why I have attached the ""Epileptic Seizure"" label to the project.* Color Palette: The color palette to apply to the output.* Merge Technique: The method used to combine the different patterns.* Patterns: The various patterns that can be combined to form the overall resulting tiled pattern.* Pattern Scales: The scales used to combine patterns. Higher scale values provide more visible pattern repetition.* Deformers: An optional additional spatial deformation of a pattern.* Deformer Scales: The scale of the deformation itself. Lower values use less of the deformation space, while higher values include more.* Detail: Acts as a filter on the visual complexity of the overall tiled pattern. Lower values will reduce visual complexity, while higher values will increase it.* Rotation Rate/Scroll Rates: How fast should the image rotate or scroll. Note: adjusting these parameters may result in visuals that trigger motion sickness.* Zoom: Lower values zoom in, higher values zoom out.* Round Scales Up?: When checked the pattern scales are rounded up to the nearest integer.* Animate?: Should some parameters be adjusted with the passing of time?* Low Res?: When checked, force device pixel density to 1, which reduces strain on the GPU, but may result in graphical artifacts. I usually keep this unchecked unless I want to lighten the load on the GPU.* Anti-alias?: When checked each pixel will be sampled multiple times to attempt to smooth out possible aliasing. This will put more load on the GPU, and will typically be slower. Can be useful when ""Low Res?"" is enabled.### HOWTO ###Here's how I find interesting things.First, I lock all of the parameters below ""Pattern 3"" at their default values. I will also usually lock both Deformers to ""Empty"", as they can sometimes hide interesting patterns while exploring, and then I experiment with enabling one or both once I have found something interesting.You can also explore the options individually (to a certain degree) by setting other patterns to ""Empty"". This can make how patterns affect one another more obvious when you set them.At this point I'll randomize the parameters, and then do one of the following:- If I see something that's extremely noisy/detailed, I'll turn down the ""Detail"" level, which can sometimes smooth things out.- If a tiling is very tight, I'll lower the ""Zoom"" to see more of the pattern, or the reverse if I want to see more overview.- If there's still a lot of aliasing/noise in the image, sometimes enabling anti-aliasing will help, but that will affect performance. I usually try to adjust the Scale/Detail/Zoom before resorting to anti-aliasing.- Interesting patterns are formed by the scale factors controlling how pattern overlap happens. Sometimes enabling ""Round Scales Up?"" will introduce some appealing visual symmetry.- Enable one or both of the deformers to see what impact they have on the pattern.Finally, once I've found a pattern that's interesting, I may enable scrolling or rotation. Note that enabling additional movement can increase graphical aliasing, so anti-aliasing may be required depending on the pattern.I hope you enjoy the exploration process!- Jeff Palmer",

This led me to reflect on the topic, concluding that interpersonal relationships are essential for human life, and this reflection has inspired me to carry out this project.Starting from simple elements such as points, lines and circles, I have built this abstract generative artwork that tries to symbolize the human personality and how the relationships we have affect us and shape our personality, the result is a wide variety of interactive compositions that are very interesting visually, even sometimes hypnotic.

As these circles approach each other, they connect and unite through lines that form constellations, symbolizing how our contacts and relationships come together to create something bigger and more complete.The artwork evokes the emotion and awe we feel when connecting with others online, and how Web 3.0 is giving rise to new forms of collaboration and opportunities for the global community. The lines that connect the circles resemble invisible threads that bind us all together, leading us towards new discoveries and broader horizons.Each run of the program generates a unique image, making each owner of the artwork have something special and meaningful that represents their connection to the community.

Improbable Drafts,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/improbable-drafts,working,"A weaving draft serves as both instructions on how to set up a loom and how to weave a piece, and gives a preview of what the end result will look like.Improbable Drafts is a collection of weaving drafts that you'd probably never see. These drafts may contain errors, be too complicated to set up, produce undesirable, unusable, or even ugly results, or be an overly complicated means to an end. Or, maybe you'll end up with a draft that just makes sense - that's improbable itself!~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~Each draft has four components: threading (top left), tie-up (top right), treadling (bottom right), and draw down (bottom left).The threading describes how your warp (vertical) yarns are positioned, and what colour each warp yarn is. Each row in the threading grid is a shaft, and each warp yarn is a column. A warp yarn can only be threaded through one shaft. The shafts control which yarns are raised or lowered, which, in combination with the weft (horizontal) yarn, form a pattern. A threading pattern is read from right to left, and the pattern continues for the desired width of piece.The tie up determines which shafts are attached to which treadles. Treadles, operated by a weaver's feet, can lift one or more shafts - these control which shafts are in use, and allows for more than one to be at a time. There is one column for each treadle and one row for each shaft in the grid.The treadling shows what order the treadles are pressed in, and therefore what order the shafts are raised in. When shafts are raised, the weft yarn is passed through. The treadling also shows which colour of weft yarn to use. The pattern is read from top to bottom, and repeats for the entire length of the weaving.Finally, the draw down puts all of these pieces together and shows a preview of what the woven piece will look like when combining the threading and treadling patterns, as well as the warp and weft yarn colours.The threading, tie up, and treadling in this project are all ones commonly used in weaving, including tabby, twill, overshot, monk's belt, and more, with some improbable alterations.

The reverse time migration (RTM from now on) carries out a propagation of the wave field forward in time and at the end a backward propagation is carried out, that is, you temporarily retrace your steps. This is really just one part of the algorithm as it is too robust to fully render, but I remember it was the most fun part because of the images I got. Therefore, in this artistic version, the movement of waves forwards and backwards in time is parodied.Based on the above, RTM (artistic version) has several ✳️PARAMETERS✳️ that you can modify to obtain unique results, as follows:✅ [ seed ] : it is the classic seed present in all the projects without parameters, modify it and you will obtain new distributions of the objects conditioned by it randomly.✅ [ Theme ] : select between two themes for the image:-full wave: shows the trace of the wave when moving forward-front wave: only shows the front of the wave erasing the trace✅ [ Number-waves ]: controls the number of “waves” to be drawn✅ [ Wave-weight ]: controls the thickness of the wave edge✅ [ Initial-size ]: controls the initial size with which the waves will begin to form at the instant t=0✅ [ Expansion time]: it is not an average of time, it is just a counter that controls how long the expansion lasts and therefore the contraction of the waves✅ [ Border-width ]: controls the width of the border of the full image frame✅ [ Border-color]: controls the color of the image frame✅ [ Background-color] : controls the background color of the image✅ [ Use palettes ] : if this box is active, the colors will automatically be governed by the palette you select. Therefore, all other parameters related to color will stop working. It has 54 color palettes formed with every intention of achieving a good harmony :)by RosbelDev",

Spark,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/spark-2,working,"Excited to release my genesis generative art piece, Spark! It’s paired with a 1-minute production of my song, Hands. 🎶And, not only do you get a unique rendering, you get infinite renderings. Let’s go over Spark.✨I fell in love with generative art even before participating in web3 as a musician, and last year began teaching myself p5js so I could make art to pair with my music (and because it’s cool af) 💻 Through experimenting with the code, creating different textures and shapes, the project began to take on a geometric/abstract/cosmos vibe, which led me to the name ""Spark"" — to me, symbolizing a new beginning in both life and artistic expression. Each rendering simultaneously gives me a sense of grounding and inspiration to reach for the stars. ✨While finishing up Spark, the idea of each collector only getting one iteration made me sad. Why force scarcity on something when its beauty is in how limitless it is? I get joy from clicking the render button over and over, and that’s what I want collectors of Spark to feel, too. 🙂What IS scarce is the number of tokens in the collection, along with the initial rendering when you mint, since it’s tied to the transaction hash. This is the rendering you will see any time you first open your NFT. You can then render a new canvas any time and save/download any renderings you like. The renderings after your initial one will also stay consistent, and in the same order.I designed Spark for people who want to hang this type of art on their walls, either with a digital frame or by saving the canvas to print. Digitally, it's responsive to any screen size in a square 1:1 aspect ratio. Rendering, saving, and audio controls are done using the mouse, key commands, or touch (in case you have a digital frame with no keyboard).The music is a 1-minute version of my song, Hands. The lyrics pair well with the geometric/abstract/cosmos vibe of the art. ✨🎶And I feel numb with wonderment,yet at ease with where I am.As life surrounds my every breath,the world turns in my hands. 🎶The full song is consistent with that theme — how I like to find life in everything. You can come request Hands anytime I’m streaming on platforms like Twitch and Hypeshot. :)HOW TO INTERACT WITH SPARK- Play/Pause: The “P” key or click/tap the canvas- Stop/Rewind to Beginning: The “S” key or click/tap and hold the canvas for longer than 1 second- Volume: Click/Tap and drag up and down the last 1/10th of the canvas on the right- Refresh Canvas: The “R” key or click/tap and hold the canvas for longer than 2 seconds- Save Canvas: Keys “1” - “8”, which saves the canvas at 1000x1000px - 8000x8000px respectively. Saving adds my signature in the bottom right corner.THE 14 COLOR PALETTES IN SPARK- Are You Out There?- This Red Sunset’s A Dress, And You Wear It Well- Yappari Midori- Teal Is Back In- Take A Breath- You’re Making Me Blush- What’s On The Menu?- Coffee Anytime- I Like Terracotta- Content With Contrast- Find Me At The Lake- Blueberry Ice Cream- Lunar Lens- Sketch PadWhen you save a canvas, the palette name will be in the file name.For optimal viewing, please use a laptop, desktop, iPad, or digital canvas.

There's something about the limitation of using only binary colors that enables me to appreciate abstraction purely for its form.Note on the name: The series draws its name from Sayed Haider Raza of the Bombay Progressive Artists' Group. I have always admired Raza’s use of sacred geometry and his abstract work has forever been a source of inspiration.

The wires seem to be both restraining and liberating, as if holding us in place while also allowing us to break free from the constraints that bind us.As we gaze at the intricate web of wires, we are reminded of the many structures that we depend on for our security and well-being. Yet at the same time, we are forced to confront the ways in which these structures can also limit our freedom and autonomy. The artwork asks us to question what it truly means to be free in a world where so much of our lives are shaped by external forces.Despite the complexity of the image, there is a sense of hope and possibility that pervades ""Wires of Freedom"". The wires may be tangled and knotted, but they are also vibrant and alive, representing the potential for growth and change. Ultimately, this piece invites us to consider how we might find a way to navigate the many wires that surround us, so that we can create a world in which freedom and autonomy are truly valued and protected.",

DAI - distributed autonomous interaction,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/dai-distributed-autonomous-interaction,working,"This is a constantly changing artwork. Keep in mind that each time you reload your iteration or resize the canvas, even though your preferred parameters stay the same, the appearance of the artwork changes!If you know my series ZEITSTRUDEL you might recognise similarities. ZEITSTRUDEL is about capturing movement patterns. Everything is actively or passively moved by dynamics and interaction. Everything follows rules. Crawling insects, a flock of bird or fish, leaves on the surface of water, grass in the wind, etc.DAI simulates these movement patterns and extends the natural models with abstract digital capabilities.Two visual elements produce different outcomes:1. The dots themselves draw traces of their path2. Lines between the dots: I bet you did some string art back in elementary school :)How does it work:A random number of dots with a random amount of movement are placed on the canvas. They sense dots in a given radius. They attract or repel each other and they flock together, or not. They draw their movement path and/or their connection to neighbouring dots. Doing all that they paint a more or less beautiful, chaotic, colourful picture. You will mint an iteration based on a given set of parameters. Your mint will always have that set of parameters. However the movement and so the drawing is completely random. Every time you load your minted iteration it will look different. The longer you run an iteration the more it gets painted over and over and over (at least in most cases.)Some iterations build up with high speed. Some require patience because they build up slowly. Some might even get to a halt and don’t develop any further. Some are delicate, some are bold. Some dots escape beyond their set borders, most don’t. Some colors are piercing your eyes, some shine subtly.Further random features you will only know after minting:* You start with visible Lines and/or Dots, you can always switch modes with your keyboard* Dot size: a weighted size representation of the actual mass of the dot* Rainbow: This is a rare feature of 10% probability. Switch between rainbow and your selected color palette with [c]You have some keyboard functionality:Switch modes[1] reset and show only lines[2] reset and show only path[3] show lines and path, don’t reset[r] reset current drawing without reloading[p] pause for admiration [b] let the dots bounce off of the border or let them pass through[o] switch border around artwork on/off[f] switch flocking on / off  (If a piece got stuck and nothing is moving anymore, try to switch flocking.

Turtle Vision,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/turtle-vision,working,"## PROJECT DESCRIPTIONWhat is it like to be a sea turtle in the age of plastic?Our global addiction to single-use plastic is destroying our marine environment. Over 11 million metric tons of waste plastic enter our oceans every year. Thankfully, there is a growing force of ocean defenders rising to combat this crisis. Activists and non-profit organizations around the world are working diligently to solve the ocean plastic problem — but they don’t have nearly enough resources to succeed. This project aims to help.Turtle Vision uses code, chaos, and regl.js to offer us a glimpse into the experience of a sea turtle in 2023, struggling to survive in an ailing ocean. Turtles prey heavily on jellyfish, but have trouble distinguishing them from the countless plastic bags clogging our oceans given their similar shapes and movement patterns. Because of this, we are finding more and more sea turtles dead on beaches, having starved to death with bellies full of plastic bags.We believe that generative art can help to reverse this trend and restore sea turtle populations to pre-plastic levels. Turtle Vision aims to raise money for 5 Gyres, one of the foremost nonprofit groups in the war on single-use plastic. 5 Gyres has a storied pedigree in this space, and has also emerged as a leader amongst conservation organizations in its embrace of blockchain technology.This project is a collaboration between renowned generative artist @s_r_r_z, the creator of the iconic Generative Octopuses, and @Casson.tez, a professional ocean conservation activist who works at the intersection of environmentalism and web3.We are grateful for the support of Tender.art, fx(hash), TZAPAC, the Tezos Foundation, and the entire Tezos community.## EDITION- Series size: 534 (it's SEA)- Price: 111-99-77-55-33- Charity share: 40% of primaries, 5% of secondaries## TECHNICALSVisuals:This artwork portrays jellyfish intermixed with litter in the ocean, such as plastic bags and masks.

You can use the mouse and scroll-wheel on desktop, or touch controls on mobile, to shift the camera around. Because the wrap effect is happening in the screen space not in the world space, you might notice the wrapping makes rotating the scene a little unusual.Some notes on the parameters:- The location of a particle can be ""wrapped around"" in space. The wrapping can be either horizontal or vertical (random), or both (Double wrap checkbox), and you can change the ranges of the wrapping behavior. The Wrap factor param mixes between the original position and the wrapped one.- The curves can either be a straight line from A to B, or a Bezier curve, the param Line factor decides how much of each.- Particle spread factor decides how far from the curve the particles can be spread.- The curves rotate, each at a different speed. You can influence the overall speed multiplier and the axis of rotation.- If you choose a palette, be aware of the shuffle checkbox. With shuffle turned on any one of the palette colors can be the background, and the rest is for the particles.- Be careful with the number of particles per curve and the total number of curves. More particles overall means some devices might have a harder time rendering this smoothly.- Different browser and hardware combinations seem to behave slightly different when it comes to the particle size.

chiaroscuro,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/chiaroscuro,working,"The old master made thousands of drawings during centuries. Always starting with tiny dots, thin strokes, short and long lines that could shape textures where light bounces and shadow diffuses. Thanks to his formula, he could draw anything that we know and that we don’t know. And that’s what he did, and because of that, people named him the master. But one day, ages ago, no one cared anymore about words and things, and because of that, he left out the figures, the landscapes, animals, plants and objects, and even the deities and their symbols. “I can’t stop drawing”, his hand said to him. “Then we draw”, the master answered. “Look at this pebble the many ricochets it’s having upon the clear and calm water. From now on, we have to draw like this. Repetition, refraction, randomness, intuition, gesture. Take a sheet and give the first stroke.” And something new happened, something both bright and dark.

The strings are then randomly selected from the curated set and displayed in various fonts and patterns, evoking a retro-PC style inspired by 90s net.art.An advantage of using so little data to train a model (yes, a year of content is nothing in AI terms) is that it allows the model to run wild and create funny and fantastical diversions.

Romeo and Juliet on Punched Cards (Free),https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/romeo-and-juliet-on-punched-cards-(free),working,"This artwork takes a modern approach to printing Shakespeare's classic play, Romeo and Juliet. The text is printed on old punched cards from an IBM machine from the 1970s, giving it a vintage look and feel. The lines of text are selected randomly from the play, creating a unique and dynamic representation of the story.But there's a twist - the text on the punched cards is actually readable by the old machines, but it doesn't make sense to them. This highlights the stark contrast between the old and new technologies and how much has changed since the 1970s. Despite the advancements in technology, however, the beauty and significance of Romeo and Juliet remain timeless.This artwork is a celebration of the past, present, and future, and the ways in which technology has evolved and continues to shape our lives.Additionally, to ensure a fair distribution of the text from Romeo and Juliet, only 1024 tokens were selected at random. This allows for a diverse range of quotes and scenes to be included in the artwork, while still capturing the essence of the play as a whole. Whether you're a Shakespeare enthusiast or a tech-savvy individual, this artwork offers something for everyone to appreciate.",

Concrete jungles,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/concrete-jungles,working,"- ""Concrete jungle"": A Metaphor for Urban Development and Environmental Impact -When we talk about a ""concrete jungle,"" we are describing urban areas that are full of buildings and artificial structures but lacking in natural green spaces. While cities are important for bringing people together and forming communities, it is essential to consider their impact on the environment when we develop them.Replacing green spaces with concrete and asphalt can lead to dirty air and water, soil erosion, and climate change, all of which can hit the most vulnerable members of society the hardest. However, it's worth noting that not all urban development necessarily leads to negative environmental impacts, and some development may even have positive effects such as reducing sprawl and protecting natural habitats.Moreover, the lack of natural elements can cause people to feel disconnected and isolated from nature, which can lead to anxiety and emotional distress, especially for those who already struggle with feeling disconnected.Investing in public transportation to reduce car pollution is one way to mitigate the negative impacts of urban development. However, it's important to acknowledge that public transportation may not be accessible or affordable for everyone, particularly those living in low-income neighborhoods or rural areas. Additionally, the effectiveness of public transportation in reducing car pollution can depend on factors such as the availability of alternative transportation options, population density, and urban design.Creating sustainable, inclusive, and livable cities means taking into account everyone's diverse needs and perspectives. This means prioritizing green spaces and eco-friendly infrastructure to work towards building urban environments that benefit everyone's well-being. It's worth noting that the effects of the ""concrete jungle"" can vary depending on social and cultural differences. Therefore, it's crucial to consider these differences and work towards creating urban environments that are sustainable, inclusive, and livable for everyone.----------------------------------Press 's' to save.Press 'a' to skip the animation.Double-click to create according to the screen size.----------------------------------",

It is also the tool for artists that dates back to the most ancient times. By using charcoal as the the primary medium for the exhibition ‘Organic Matr’ (and resulting series of physical pieces created in collaboration with Brooklyn-based lab ArtMatr), the works creates bonds between technology and the rawest tool that was touched by the human hand, and highlights how the cycle of life is also the cycle of regeneration of matter.Since the generative process _that uses programming code and the intervention of randomness_ was used to design the physical pieces, the long-form generative series Charcoal Seeds is a natural way to seamlessly extend back into the digital realm the ideas of matter and physicality, while showing the elements at work in the creation process. In each iteration a virtual seed will encapsulates the essence of organic forms and patterns. The graphic style itself tries to convey the organic feeling of tools and materials such as chalk, ink, paintbrushes. —— - ""Charcoal Seeds"" offers a WYSIWYG experience : by deriving the randomness from the minter’s wallet address, it is guaranteed that what you see onscreen after adjusting the params will be your actual NFT.

COMPLEX,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/complex-3,working,"""In the year of 3023 the planet Earth from which all humans descend, today is called 'EARTH01', it is so called because it was the first planet to be completely destroyed by humanity. During the last few years of this planet's existence, the human race used all its resources to find new habitable planets and ways to reach them.After long years of tireless research, they began to discover new places where they could survive and explore, and thus they migrated from planet to planet and formed human colonies for thousands of years. Then one day some of them arrived on a new planet to begin their colonization, in this place they found trees very similar to the ones they knew, through ancient records of their ancestors, to have existed on EARTH01.But unlike the trees on EARTH01, these were gigantic and instead of just fruit, some species also produced many types of important resources for human survival, such as water (extracted from some types of fruit), and even precious ores similar to of your home planet. To grow and survive, trees needed nothing more than a specific light from that solar system, which was very plentiful on that planet. These trees were then named 'Bellatrix', which in Latin (an almost lost language of EARTH01) meant 'warrior'.With this discovery they thought had in their hands an infinite power, and so they began the same cycle done on all other planets, sucking all possible resources without thinking about the possibility of them having an end.After a few hundred years the planet began to crumble due to exploitation, and all the chaos caused by humans due to their greed and selfishness turned against them. Few Bellatrixes were left alive, the few existing rivers on the planet dried up, the woods and forests before full of life and those wonderful trees, no longer existed...Society was in decline, laws no longer had effect on this civilization, there were groups of marauders, living there was no longer something safe. That planet full of life was now a desert planet, surrounded by sand dunes that swallowed the ruins of ancient buildings.It was then that people realized that the same mistake had been made for all these thousands of years, generation after generation, no matter how fertile the new planet was, humanity always managed to deplete it and its resources. But it was too late, this civilization no longer had enough resources for them to leave this planet.With that, a movement began for the preservation of these trees and the creation of complexes where people and Bellatrixes could live in safety, away from looters and other dangers now common in this place. The complexes were formed by units, which were raised many meters high to hinder the action of invaders, they were like small and large cities, but now far from the ground. These units were supported by small central columns, the more units and Bellatrixes in the complex, the more powerful and populous it was.And that's how they lived for many years, in these complexes there were rules and each one had their own specific ones, and they worked autonomously. Utilizing the resources obtained through the Bellatrixes and finally understanding their importance, they were able to keep the population alive and continue their civilization.""This is a record found in the diary of an unidentified space traveler and the only existing record of civilization on this planet.------------------------------------About the work:This work was built entirely with code using only math, logic and 2D shapes to create light, shadow and perspective.------------------------------------Features:""Palette"": 23 Palettes""Units"": 1 > 45""Bellatrixes"": 0 > 135""Resource level"": Very Low, Low, Medium, High, Very High""Population"": Very Small, Small, Medium, High, Very High""Clouds"": True, False""Sun/Moon"": Sun, Moon, False------------------------------------Constrols in live mode:On desktop: Press 's' or 'S' to save as PNG (2534x3596)On mobile: Touch the screen to save as PNG (2534x3596)Artwork created with p5.js and love.February-March 2023",

Draftsmanship,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/draftsmanship,working,"Draftsmanship - made with p5js by Schiftcopy 2023The artwork consists of various circles in different sizes and positions, all drawn in black on a white background. These circles are generated using a generative p5js code, which creates a unique and intricate pattern that is monochrome in nature. Each circle is placed in a seemingly random location, creating a sense of movement and dynamism throughout the piece. The circles are also overlapping and intersecting, adding depth and complexity to the overall design. The use of monochrome colors creates a sense of unity and harmony in the artwork, while the unique pattern generated by the code adds a touch of randomness and unpredictability. Overall, this artwork is a stunning example of the creative potential of generative art and the beauty that can be found in simplicity.If you have a p5js artwork that you would like to turn into a physical, tangible piece of art, you can do so by converting it into an SVG file and using a penplotter to draw it onto paper. The process involves exporting your p5js artwork as an SVG file, which is a vector graphics format that can be scaled to any size without losing quality. Once you have the SVG file, you can use a penplotter to draw the artwork onto paper using a pen or marker.The resulting artwork will be a unique monochrome work of art on paper, with a hand-drawn quality that is both charming and elegant. The precision of the penplotter ensures that every line and curve is perfectly reproduced, while the monochrome color scheme adds a sense of simplicity and harmony to the piece. Because the artwork is created using a penplotter, there may be small imperfections or variations in line weight, giving each piece a unique character and personality.Overall, converting your p5js artwork into an SVG file and using a penplotter to create a physical version is a great way to bring your digital art into the physical world and create something truly unique and beautiful.Current artworks works produced under the license CC0 are essentially in the public domain, which means that the creator has waived all rights to the artwork and has given anyone the freedom to use, modify, and distribute the work without restriction.

For example, ants can exhibit intelligent collective behavior, fungi are highly successful organisms that make up a larger biomass than all animals combined, and each tree is unique.These emergent properties arise from the environment in which these simple rules operate. A tree's growth is influenced by many factors such as soil, water, seasons, wind, humidity, light, and interactions with other plants and animals.This series is a reflection on the beauty and uniqueness of each living thing, and how complexity emerges from simplicity.To illustrate these concepts, we’ve used a custom variant of the ""reaction-diffusion"" algorithm, which approximates some biological systems. This algorithm was introduced by Alan Turing in 1952 in his paper titled ""The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis."" The rules are very simple but by changing the initial conditions and adding perturbations, we can reach very different visual outcomes.In this way we create a dialog between the strict mathematical rules interpreted by the machine and the organic visuals that emerge from it.--------Warning: This piece is GPU intensive, it may not render on lower end devices.Press 'S' to save the image at the current scalePress 'H' to save the image at 2560px resolutionPress 'P' to save the image at 3840px resolutionCreated with Three.js--------William WatkinsApril 2023",

Woman at a Crosswalk,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/woman-at-a-crosswalk,working,"Bobby:  Fifteen years ago, a woman stood at a crosswalk in my hometown of Oklahoma City, momentarily gazing and gesturing toward the horizon. At that moment, I was passing time taking random photographs as I waited for a friend.Weeks or months later, I noticed the photograph and made a drawing based on the woman at the crosswalk. In the drawing, I dialed up the drama of her expression and gesture, gave her a theatrical hair style, and placed her in a field of tall flowers at night.I used the drawing to make a screen print. The screen print was exhibited at a handful of local venues in the years that followed, and was one of the first pieces I minted as an NFT in the spring of 2021 (later collected by the illustrious Anna Condo).I used the screen print as a seed image to create images in Midjourney, which began my ‘Thousandfold’ collection. I took images from the first generation of Thousandfold as seed images for the second generation, images from the second generation as seed images for the third generation, and images from the third generation as seed images for the fourth generation. I haven’t stopped there, but in the fourth generation, the figures (for whatever reason) turned to face the viewer. These are the images used for this collaboration.Just when I thought this particular series had gone about as far as it could go, Stephen came along and did some truly magical things.sspboyd:  This collaboration plays with the ideas of light and shadow; deconstruction and recreation.Each edition begins by selecting the light or shadow side of one of Bobby's images and making that the ""mask"" to be recreated.

mirage.,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/mirage.,working,"mirage. This generative artwork is a mesmerizing visual representation of the illusionary nature of mirages, while also taking inspiration from the color field paintings of Mark Rothko. The artwork is composed of vertical hatched lines, arranged in overlapping and intersecting planes to create a complex and layered composition.At first glance, the lines appear to be a static pattern of color blocks, reminiscent of the flat planes of color used in Rothko's paintings. However, upon closer inspection, the viewer will notice subtle variations in the thickness and spacing of the lines, creating a sense of texture and depth. The lines seem to shift and move, creating the illusion of a shimmering heat haze, much like the effect of a mirage in a desert landscape.As the viewer continues to observe the artwork, they will notice new patterns emerging from the seemingly chaotic lines. The lines form intricate shapes and patterns, including geometric designs and organic forms, reminiscent of the way that mirages can distort and reshape the appearance of objects. The colors used in the artwork are also reminiscent of Rothko's paintings, with deep, saturated hues that blend and bleed into one another.Overall, this generative artwork combines the illusionary quality of mirages with the abstract color field style of Mark Rothko, resulting in a captivating and intriguing visual experience. It is a testament to the power of generative art to create beauty and complexity from simple mathematical patterns, while also paying homage to the influential artists who have shaped our understanding of color and form.As a feature, there are 23 color palettes, some of them taken from ""Studio Yorktown Color Town Hall"" by @StudioYorktown (studioyorktown.github.io/coloryorktownhall)To download high-resolution 3000x3900 'PNG' file, open 'LIVE' and press 'S'Aptil 2023Made with p5JS library",
The Beauty In Small Things,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/the-beauty-in-small-things,working,"""The Beauty In Small Things"" marks a new page in my collection of rules-based emergent systems. Like my previous projects,it is based on millions of transparent lines interacting in unpredictable ways. This time, the following rules are applied:- Place N circles in the canvas and pick a random point on each circle.- Assign a color from the current palette to each point- At each step, rotate the point along its circle, and draw a segment between the 2 closest points in the set.Finding the closest points in a set is another classic computer science problem. This implementation uses the sweep line algorithm to avoid the O(n^2) complexity of the naive method. Rendering still requires a good GPU (with the density at its maximum, it draws 5.7 million lines)Playing with the token parameters will reward collectors with very diverse and unexpected outputs.For this token I have added 2 important parameters:- Hash Override: when set to a valid hash value, this forces using this value for the token generation. This allows collectors to mint the exact same output as the one they see while adjusting the parameters.- Micro Variation: one downside of using Hash Override is that the same output can be generated multiple time, by using the same hash. The Micro Variation parameters counterbalances that, by adding a variable amount of randomness taken from the original mint hash. This ensures the outputwill be very similar to the one currently displayed, but not exactly identical.*** WARNING *** If Micro-Variation is set to 0, the output is 100% deterministic and other collectors will be able to generate the exact same output by copying the Hash Override value.Like ""The Traveling Salesman"", ""The Beauty In Small Things"" is an open edition that starts with 10.000 editions priced at 1tz.

Chromalign,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/chromalign,working,"A relatively simple idea: columns filled with many thin horizontal lines, layered with complexity from colour features, stroke styles, and column perturbations. The compositions that emerge may be harmonious or asynchronous, comforting or jarring, wistful, mysterious, subtle, or bold.The piece is generated as follows:First, borders and columns are defined. The canvas may have one or two borders, ranging from small to large, and the inner border may or may not have a coloured edge and fill. If they are not coloured, the feature ""Hidden Background"" will be true. Each column is assigned three colours at random from one of several possible colour palettes. The top and bottom boundaries of each column are set, and in some iterations, there is a chance that columns will break outside the border boundaries.As columns are drawn from top to bottom, there are several events that may occur with probabilities pre-defined for each iteration: 1) The stroke colour may switch abruptly or over a gradient between two of the three column colours. 2) A 'repeater' pattern may be triggered, where two of the column colours alternate with a given frequency and rate of decay. 3) Single 'accent' bands may occur with the third column colour. 4) 'Bulges' may form with either rectangle, diamond, sin wave, or 'skirt' shapes.There may also be horizontal bands that span the entire image, with a certain variability of height across columns.Strokes may be straight lines or Bezier curves. Bezier curves may be uniform for an iteration, where the control points of the curves are generated from a single formula for the whole image, or they may be random. Strokes may also have horizontal and/or vertical 'line fuzz', where the start and end points of the line are randomly offset in either direction.Straight strokes may or may not have a solid base-layer drawn underneath, which gives the image a more filled vs. sketched appearance. Top strokes may also be partially transparent, allowing for a layered effect.Columns are drawn in one of several possible orders, and once the initial drawing is complete, columns will be redrawn slowly and the image will evolve over time.Press '2', '4', '6', '8', or '0' to re-draw at 2K, 4K, 6K, 8K, or 10K resolution (shortest edge), which will also save an image when the initial draw is complete and before animation begins.Press 's' at any time to save an image at the current resolution.",
Buizen,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/buizen,working,"""Buizen"" is a generative art algorithm that creates interesting and somewhat chaotic compositions of tube-like shapes. The word ""Buizen"" is Dutch for ""tubes"". It was born out of exploring the fields of (arc) tangent math.The algorithm starts with filling a canvas full of circles. It then pairs up the circles, either randomly or by selecting those that are close or on the same angle. The two circles are then connected to each other as one shape using arc tangent math. The addition of hatching for shading and a hollow opening on one end creates an illusion of depth, resulting in shapes that resemble tubes.Variations in the final output are driven by differences in creating circle pairs, as well as factors such as circle packing density, circle sizes, color palette, and curvature of the tubes.",

Sometimes progress was quick, sometimes slow, and sometimes there was no improvement at all. However, overall progress has been made. In the last 6 months, important things unlocked for me, allowing me to reflect on what I've accomplished so far and translate that feeling into artistic expression.The idea I hope to convey is to inspire and encourage us to keep moving forward, even when faced with challenges.The code used to create the artwork is based on the wave function collapse algorithm, and builds tiles over a grid. Wave function collapse is a mathematical model that takes a set of input patterns and generates new patterns with similar characteristics. It is commonly used in computer graphics and game development to create procedural content. I chose this algorithm because when a tile pattern is decided, it impacts all neighboring tiles, much like the decisions we make in life._____________________-= GENERAL PARAMS =-- Seed overload + customer seed: Takes priority over fxhash when enabled, your mint will be exactly what you see.- Palette: Presets of color palettes- Pattern: Presets of compatible basic shapes patterns.

These representational figures were contrived; in the sense that they all were all designed to be drawn as a continuous line, digitized in the same direction, and they had the same number of points. This made it relatively simple for me to manipulate them as I learned to program and formulate simple algorithms.Please refer to the description for TransformationStudy23 for more background.By superimposing two creatures, one over the other, an interesting visual transformation can be made. Line segments of one image are randomly removed based on a percentage which it is drawn over another image whose line segments are added randomly with the inverse percentage. Over a series of frames, it appears that one image changes into the other. To make things a bit more visually interesting I randomly rotate the images in each frame.Figure one (upper left corner) is a randomly selected creature that I transform to a second creature (lower right corner) over 81 frames. (The sequence represented here as 9 stacked rows of 9).I choose to not add color and keep the image as true to being drawn on a plotter as was the case back in the 1970's. Black pen on a white background.I hope you enjoy my retrospective recreation of both the algorithm and its application to the creature menagerie.Please visit: www.drbillkolomyjec.com",
TransformationStudy23,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/transformationstudy23,working,"TransformationStudy23 is based on a unique image transformation algorithm from my Plotter Art era in the 1970's. This image is basically a test of the algorithm. Back then, representational images had to be digitized by hand and made available to the drawing program as a series of coordinate pairs. Rather than draw them sequentially the program converts the digitized data from points to separate line segments. These line segments can be shuffled and all or a portion of those line segments can be drawn to reveal all or a portion of a figure.By superimposing two figures, one over the other, an interesting visual transformation can be made. Line segments of one image are randomly removed based on a percentage which it is drawn over another image whose line segments are added randomly with the inverse percentage. Over a series of frames, it appears that one image changes into the other.Figure one (upper left corner) is a set of horizontal lines that I transform to a second figure (lower right corner) a set of vertical lines, over 49 frames. (The sequence represented here as 7 stacked rows of 7).Each generative instance is rendered using 4 separate ""coloring"" algorithms: 1) all black lines, 2) horizontal lines on random color, vertical lines another random color, 3) horizontal lines one random color, vertical lines the RGB complement of that color and, 4) each set of vertical or horizontal line groups takes on a color based on the position of its center in a random color space. Color spaces are randomly determined for each figure.Please visit www.drbillkolomyjec.com",

It's my first project using fx(params) and I'm hoping it will be a fun and rewarding experience!Params:The colour palettes are algorithmic and minimum and maximum saturation and value can be controlled by fx(params). Both min and max can be of the same value, which helps getting monochrome outputs (0 for both min and max saturation to get white lines, 0 for both min and max value to get black lines). Hue value is specified as min (starting) hue and hue range, to make sure user can create image with hue from the beginning and the end of the spectrum omitting the middle colours. For each block of strokes the HSV values are randomly drawn from the specified ranges for each pattern, so note the outputs can still vary quite a bit in terms of colours. Limit the hue range to get more expected outputs. The rest is for the minter to play with and doesn't require much explanation. In most cases you can pick the maximum value while the minimum value is set in the code, so here as well - the lower the values - the least variety in the outputs.Controls:By default, the rendered resolution is twice the window size.- Press [1] to change the resolution from 2000px x 2000px- Press [2] to change the resolution from 4000px x 4000px- Press [3] to change the resolution from 6000px x 6000px- Press [4] to change the resolution from 8000px x 8000px- Press [5] to change the resolution from 10000px x 10000px- Press [S] or [s] to save a PNG file with the current resolution (be patient with bigger resolutions)Created with p5.jsArtist: Magonometria, @magonometriaApril, 2023",

By doing this, we can create some *very* complex appearing geometry using some relatively simple rules.Finally, this is an intense simulation and requires a somewhat powerful GPU to properly be enjoyed.PARAMS :::::::::::::Firstly, DON'T BE INTIMIDATED! There are a lot of params in this project, but mostly designed to allow tweaking, rather than radically affecting the outcome. In addition, there are 3 boolean overrides that allow you to ensure that various property sets are governed fully by the random number generator (RNG). Finally, I'm providing a random seed that allows the preview to match the mint exactly.Random seedThis is a replacement for the hash in RNG. Use it to generate a seed for YOUR token.Geometry size 1-3Each geometry size corresponds to a different component of the size of the geometry depenting on the type selected. Play around with these as you please, some selections will result in very large geometry, but there's a LOT of nuance in here.Geometry typeThis select field determines the type of geometry drawn within our KIFS folds.Environment colorThe color of the environment. This will change the color of the background (in the distance) and the fog.Object colorModifies the base color of the geometry. Mid-level greys will work best here, but you can get some very exotic outcomes with some small variations here.Light colorThe color of the light source.Fresnel colorThis color corresponds to the Fresnel shading, more colloquially this sort of shading is called ""rim lighting""GammaThe gamma provides different values for the gamma color correction values. This value will dramatically affect the general color balance in the piece, safe values are around the mid-gray area.Fold angles 1-2This will modify the angles that the algorithms fold the xy / xz geometry by before drawing.Offset 1-3These values determine how far the algorithm translates the space, after folding, before drawing geometry into it. These values will change the position of the objects within the folds.Modulo A-BThese select fields determine how the algorithm draws new pieces of geometry against old. Play around with them.Light intensityThe intensity of the light source.Light attenuationHow quickly the light fades, away from the source.Light distanceHow far from the camera the light appears.Fresnel intensityHow intense the Fresnel shading appears.CONTROLS :::::::::::Mouse - Click and drag to move the camera around in the space.Q/E - Roll the camera.R/F - Change the speed of the camera.SPACE - Stop the camera from moving.O - Output a still picture without DOF.P - Output a still picture with DOF.URL PARAMS :::::::::&still=trueThis will just render a still image.&dpr=XWhere X is a number.

Vanishing Horizons,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/vanishing-horizons,working,"""I never wanted color to be color. I never wanted texture to be texture, or images to become shapes. I wanted them all to fuse together into a living spirit."" - Clyfford StillI have spent most of my life residing in urban environments. While figurative art is not a style I typically pursue in my own work, I delight in discovering abstract elements within it. The cities I've inhabited have consistently offered me the chance to do so through their architectural landscapes.Le Corbusier once said that a metropolis's abstract skyline serves as its autobiography, etched in steel and glass, unveiling its history, character, and ambitions. In this series, my aim has been to encapsulate that sentiment using a minimalistic canvas and a monochromatic palette. Abstract expressionism remains my lens for viewing every artwork. The style of this series is my homage to Clyfford Still, an abex artist I have always admired. His ability to convey profound meaning through seemingly empty and unfilled canvases has always intrigued me.

These strange trees, sometimes more like huge wild grasses, grow so wildly into each other.I experienced it in all sorts of seasonal change, packed with snow is definitely among the most amazing! While playing around with different branching system code snippets, a more and more complex image composition came together. The final script for this project on fx(hash) was finally given more randomness for a wider range of different outputs and an additional random grain filter.Project link: https://e-art.co/project/CODE-BLOSSOM/Many thanks to jesse (jbird) for the good collaboration, which ultimately made it possible to get this work released.copyright © 2023 | license cc 4.0 BY-NC-ND",
Sunburst,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/sunburst,working,"""Sunburst"" is a homage to Kenneth Noland, created in the artist's signature style and colors. Simple geometric shapes - circles, squares, and triangles - are arranged in a dynamic and rhythmic composition. The bold, bright colors of yellow, red, blue, and brown are applied in thin, translucent layers, creating a relationship between form and color, as well as the interplay between the different shapes and hues. The circles, squares, and triangles appear to float and dance across the surface of the canvas, creating a sense of movement and energy. At the same time, the subtle variations in color and texture create a sense of depth and complexity, inviting the viewer to linger and explore the work further.Click [s] to save a PNG file.",

MP - Colors,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/mp-colors,working,"Movie Posters--- --- --- --- ---I had this idea a couple of years ago when started to create my ""portfolio projects"" that I can showcase as an aspiring data scientist. At that time I created a webapp that scraped the movie posters based on the user input then applied k-means clustering to extract the dominant colors from the image and at the final step it created a list of colors and their respective hex codes. I remember showing this little project of mine at one of the job interview back then and I got hired. Few months ago, when I started to discover generative art as my new artistic hobby, I revisited this project and wanted to create something nice that I would like to showcase. Then I started to jot down my ideas and discovered different ways to visualize values and colors. Finally I ended up scraping 200 movie posters and using a k-means clustering to extract the dominant colors from the images in python. I saved the data in JSON and started to work on the visual part. When I started to discover artists using isometric views, I really fell in love with the idea to apply it to my project as well. With the coding almost finished, fxhash came out with fx(params) which I really liked as an idea and immediately wanted to utilize.

The system randomly determines which composition should be the first in the line. This will also be the saved image that the fxhash system creates. If you don't click or touch anything, the animation will loop continuously. If you click into the area anywhere, the controller will appear and the animation will stop. Until you get to the next composition and the animation stops, the pause button flashes until now you can't press anything, all buttons are disabled. If the animation has stopped, the buttons are enabled again, and you can move the camera in 3D space by dragging. The controls have left and right arrows that can be used to step between compositions. The animation restarts with the play button.There are also a few other buttons:- There is a save button which is a floppy disk. A menu will then appear, offering to save images of different proportions, with the default aspect ratio generated by the program code at the top.

Budding Spring,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/budding-spring,working,"The days are getting longer.  The snow is melting.  What was once quietly resting out the winter months begins to stir.  A couple days of sunshine after some rain is all it takes to signal the rebirth of Spring.  Brown hues miraculously shift to green, the trees begin to bud, song birds return to chase the wakening insects; there’s a change in the air.  The promise of a Budding Spring has arrived!A symphony of generative systems brings the season to life in this skillfully crafted token designed and coded by the prolific artist, Ed Cavett.   ‘Budding Spring’ is a fully generative code painting–a stunning representation of the visual power of p5.js and the creative talent of its dedicated creator.The volume of the calm scene stretches through a dense, hazy atmosphere.  Peeking through rising clouds, distant hills hint at the potential bounty of a fresh growing season.  Lush columns of cleverly created vegetation form the backdrop to a verdant, grassy field.  Stands of evergreen trees and budding shrubs populate the fore-space.  Frequently captured in the foreground are exquisitely detailed, branches graced with delicate, red buds.  A worn trail winds through the tall grass and clusters of pines.  As the wilderness slowly overtakes them, old fence posts can be seen marking the spot of a long-since abandoned and overgrown field.  The stillness of the morning is graced by the glow of sunrise, the waking of clouds, and the promise of a new day.Created with just the p5.js library, this generative work makes use of radial noise with stochastic vertices, 3D noise waves, multi-branching stochastic recursions, particle clouds, particle birds, and procedure layering.  In total, a dozen subsystems come together to create an outstanding code-painting.  Learn more about the procedures used in this token by visiting the artist’s YouTube channel: Draw Make & Code.The output is process-intensive, so rendering times can take as long as 2 minutes.  Procedure layering provides some output to the viewer while more intensive processes are working in the back-end.  This offers the viewer a look at the manner in which the elements are assembled into the final image.

Everything has a place?,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/everything-has-a-place,working,"- ""A place for everything, everything in its place"": A Metaphor for Organized and Environmental -Have you ever heard the phrase ""a place for everything and everything in its place""? It's been around for centuries and is often credited to Benjamin Franklin. Basically, it means that when you're organized and keep things in their proper order, you're setting yourself up for success in all areas of life. When we remember that ""place is the world and the world is where everything is"", we begin to see the interconnectedness of all things and the impact our actions can have on the natural environment.But did you know that this principle can also have a positive impact on the environment? As humans (?) continue to build and expand our cities and towns, we often disrupt natural ecosystems and habitats. This can lead to a bunch of environmental issues, like pollution, erosion, and a loss of biodiversity. By implementing ""a place for everything and everything in its place"" in our urban planning and waste management practices, we can help minimize these negative effects and create a more sustainable future.For example, by carefully designing cities with spaces designated for different functions, like parks, residential areas, and commercial districts, we can better manage our resources and reduce our impact on the natural world. And when it comes to waste management, things like recycling and separating organic waste from hazardous materials can help reduce the amount of waste that ends up polluting our land and water.It's important to remember that our actions have consequences and that everything is connected. By recognizing our role in the natural world and taking steps to preserve and protect it, we can help ensure that everything continues to have a place in it. So next time you're feeling disorganized, remember that a little effort can go a long way, not just in your personal life, but for the health of the planet too!------------------------------Press 's': to save (the world)------------------------------",

It is released in conjunction with fx(fam) 003, our third community town hall.  Like all my 2023 releases, previous collectors of my work may collect it for free. In fact, anyone may collect it for free.  But, there is a catch.  This is not intended as a fleeting show of generic support.  It’s a personal challenge.Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to elevate the artist named in your edition. Here is how it works.  Collect an edition and watch your new piece of art build.  Open it in live mode and press R.  The name of an artist will appear.  This the artist you are asked to elevate.  The artist names are from the two lists found on fxfeed.xyz: “women in genart” & “lgbtqia2s+ in genart” (see full list below).  The names themselves are fx(hash) user names, facilitating easy location of their work.How do you elevate? Here are some ideas:. Explore the artist’s work, commit their name to memory, and watch for opportunities to support them. Follow the artist on fxfeed and social media. Post about and engage in discussions about the artist’s work on social media. Take every opportunity to ask that the artist be included in events, panel discussions, podcasts, curated exhibits, newsletters, etc.. Collect the artist’s work if you have the means. List the work you’ve collected and help build the secondary market for the artist. Explore fx(elevate) editions collected by others, commit the names of those artists to memory, elevate them, repeat.If we draw attention to, and train our influence on, these important members of the fx(family), we will be the change!The other major feature of the work is the palette.

As I had no idea on how to get started, I thought about using ChatGPT to help me out. I documented the whole process to create the foundation of this artwork via the video [Create Generative Art with ChatGPT & JavaScript](https://youtu.be/PrEbE7iG2Lc).You can also read about it on my website https://nerddis.co/nd-genuary32nd-plants-chatgpt3-001 and find even more background information. ## fxhashifyAfter holding the generated code from ChatGPT in my hands, I switched to my manual process (which involves using my human brain) to convert the foundation into something that can be actually minted on fxhash. I call this ""fxhashify"", as this process is tailored to the capabilities of fxhash. If you are interested in this process, then please leave a comment on the video. If you just want to know what I changed, then please continue reading:- Used the Pseudo Random Number Generator from the params-boilerplate instead of `Math.random()`- Randomized parameters (like `x` / `y` position, `color`, `growthSpeed` and more) to control the plants, ground, sun and sky- Established the scene to have `plantsAmount` between 1 and 8- Spread the plants evenly on the ground with consistent spacing, related to the `plantsAmount`- Made sure that tall plants are in front of small plants- To prevent the plants from extending outside the scene, smaller-sized plants are placed along the edge whenever more than three plants were generated- A different `globalCompositeOperation` was used for the petals of the ""special plants"", distinguishing them from regular plants- Two different `Time of Day` were included: Sunny Day vs Rainbow Night- The proportions of the scene were kept, regardless of how it was scaled, using 2048 x 2048 px as the reference size- A lot of fine-tuning was done to make it look pretty and get the colors right in terms of lightness and saturation... <3 HSL- Added various helper functions (like `inRange` or `pseudoRandomBetween`) and the possibility to save the scene as an image by pressing ""s"" on the keyboard- The characteristic was added to continuously redraw the scene after a random timeout between 0 and 60000 ms, so that you can see the plants growing over and over again. After each redraw, `stemGrowthSpeed`, `centerGrowthSpeed` and `petalGrowthSpeed` are randomized- Included only a few fxhash features, but went into a rabbit hole for `firstRedraw` and added quotes from my most favorite movies, shows and music. But only the ones that had a connection to time- My little daughters gave me important feedback during development, so I integrated their favorite show ""My Little Pony"" into the `Flower Lightness` feature (some ponies look dark, others look very bright)- Used fxparams for `timeOfDay`, `plantsAmount`, `flowerLightness` and the `backgroundSaturation`, so that minters have an influence on the generated piece- Comments were added on all functions and everything in between## CodeEverything is JavaScript + Canvas 2D and open source under AGPLv3: https://github.com/NERDDISCO/nd-genuary32nd-plants-chatgpt3-001## Interactive- Press `s` on your keyboard to download a screenshot- The scene is redrawn every pseudo-random ms",

Rangxel,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/rangxel,working,"""Rangxel"" is part of the live outdoor art installation - 'Computational Convergence' at India Art Fair, held from 9-12 February 2023 in New Delhi. Rangxel is an interpretation of traditional Rangoli formations as tesseracts, combined to form monolithic structures. Rangoli is a traditional artform that originated in India and is typically created during rituals and festivals like Diwali. It involves drawing intricate designs, typically on the floor, using materials such as colored powders, flowers, and grains. Rangoli is meant to bring prosperity and happiness to a home and can range from simple geometric patterns to more complex depictions of nature.The Rangxel tesseracts are created through rule-based instructions, following traditional Rangoli formation principles like symmetry, repeating patterns, and themes, resulting in interconnected, multi-dimensional forms of fragments.These monolithic structures also reflect natural 3D grids found in nature such as crystals and honeycombs,presenting a deconstructed, pixelated matrix of our universe.

Star Dance,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/star-dance,working,"Star DanceThis is a 100% generative animated project. Its creation was motivated by the beauty depicted in star trail photos that show the rotation of the earth relative to the stars using long exposures. What if the stars left trails like this on their own? What if they danced in intricate patterns?One unique feature of this project is a slider that controls how abstract to render the output. It can vary from realistic starscapes to abstract geometric designs.Star Dance has 40 distinct movement patterns. Each edition gets a set of about 18 patterns that repeat in an irregular fashion until the animation is stopped. The mixing of a new movement pattern with the previous state of the stars yields intricate beautiful designs. The speed can be set to high for an energetic animation or to very slow for a subtle barely noticeable result. The speed and a couple of other settings can be controlled after minting using URL parameters.The art will fill the available space and adapt to different aspect ratios.The Params define most but not all of the qualities of each edition. The primary things that vary with the random seed are: 1) the specific motion patterns used and their order, 2) the number and positions of trees, 3) the details of some motion patterns (for example there are many different kinds of spirals used), 4) the exact color noise added to the colors defined in the params, 5) position and phase of the moon, 6) accent slashes in the sky.Most of the parameters are self-explanatory but here are a few things that are not obvious.The alpha values for colors are ignored except for the moon and foreground. If they are set to alpha=0 then the moon and foreground do not get drawn.Abstraction values over 50 use fewer stars but they are drawn using the 'style' parameter which gives each star a more complex appearance. Abstraction values also impact the moon and foreground unless the 'abstraction for' parameter is set to 'stars only'Coherence controls how many of the stars follow a new movement pattern. At lower coherence values many of the stars will remain as they were after the previous pattern. This can leave visual echos of the previous patterns giving a more complex overall result. At coherence = 100 the stars will all follow the new pattern.The theme pattern appears near the beginning and also appears more frequently than the others. Some patterns are less suitable for themes so there are 28 to choose from out of the complete set of 40. The preview image will be taken during the theme pattern.The style only affects the star appearance for abstraction levels greater than 50.When the special setting is 'erode foreground' the foreground and moon will gradually dissolve.--------------------------This is a 100% code generated project.

I'm always keenly aware, perhaps as we all are, that humanity's hold on the planet is slipping. In time we may be forced to explore new avenues for survival, but then the dream of seeking a new world is nothing new. And then, pessimistic as it may be, perhaps one day we shall be forced to simply survey a desolate and scarred Earth, and admit that despite all they did, humanity got it wrong.The piece takes place in a widescreen canvas, resolutely sticking to a monochrome rendition except in a vanishingly-rare coloured version, expected to appear in around 2.5% of pieces. Colour is interesting, of course, so there are extensive options for playing with various colour modes—details available on pressing 'I' in full-screen mode.However…  white on black, or black on white; the main piece relies on density, dot-size and texture for effect, whilst the aspect ratio not only suits modern computer screens, but allows for the expansive nature of the horizon to stretch forth.The heart of the piece is the landscape itself, a small section of a very large circle. The OpenProcessing sketch ‘Landscape Curvature’ documents my initial steps on the piece, a fumbling return to trigonometry.Curvature is thoroughly explored: a larger circle produces a nearly-horizontal line, with perpendicular features, whilst a smaller circle produces extremes of curvature, and divergingly-angled additions. Additionally, a negatively-large circle can be generated, inverting the horizon as though viewed through a fish-eye lens. Features sway towards each other, and cluster dangerously close in the centre of the piece.Although the piece is considered finished after three-hundred and sixty frames, I like the render process to be as much a point of interest as the finished piece, and so the landscape is formed progressively: thousand upon thousands of tiny points maniuplated and added to the piece over time.This artwork renders fastest and most accurately in Google Chrome.",

Furry Electric Fields,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/furry-electric-fields,working,"""Furry Electric Fields"" is a generative artwork inspired by the fields created from electrically charged particles in space. Hairs are formed following the paths of positively charged particles. The density of hairs at a specific location in space reveals information about the strength of the field at that location. Every single location in space has its own electric field strength and direction associated with it. Consequently, the hairs representing the field cannot cross each other at any given point.Positively charged particles are drawn with blue color and negatively with red. The electric field is represented by lines and shapes that flow out from the charged particles and show the direction and strength of the force they exert on each other.Field theory began as a mathematical formulation of Newtonian mechanics, providing a framework for studying the motion and forces associated with electricity and magnetism. Charles-Augustin de Coulomb showed in 1785 that the repulsive force between two electrically charged spheres obeys the same force law as Newton's law of universal gravitation: the force between two bodies is directed along the line separating the bodies, and its magnitude is proportional to the product of their charges (for gravitation, their masses) divided by the square of their distance apart.""Furry Electric Fields"" depicts the complexity and ever-changing nature of electric charge and its interactions, representing the beauty and complexity of the natural world.Wait for the progress bar to complete at the center of the canvas.After the render is completed, press [s] to save a 4000x4000px PNG file.",

Whip Shape into Shape,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/whip-shape-into-shape,working,"- ""Whip Into Shape"": A Metaphor for Achieving Justice and Equality -The expression ""whip into shape"" has wide-ranging implications that go beyond individual objectives and can be used in more generalized societal and cultural contexts. In light of complicated and urgent challenges including climate change, social inequality, and political division, the entire society may need to ""whip into shape"" in order to address these problems and find answers. This calls for teamwork, perseverance, and a shared dedication to ideals like justice, sustainability, and compassion.Whipping into shape an organization or institution can refer to creating accountable and transparent processes of governance to make sure individuals in positions of authority behave in the best interests of their constituents. This calls for a readiness to address dishonesty and unethical behavior while placing an emphasis on openness and justice. We may make sure that the institutions that run our society serve the interests of everyone by ""whipping"" these institutions into shape.Lastly (?), ""whipping into shape"" can be used to describe addressing damaging or outmoded cultural practices and ideals. A commitment to communal discipline and effort is required to advance issues such as racial justice, environmental sustainability, and gender equality. It involves affecting people's hearts and minds, pressing back against deeply rooted notions, and committing to a more just and equal society.-----Controls---------------------Press 'f': to change the background color to any other color in the palette.Press 'g': to change the background to white.Press 'h': to change the background to black.Press 'j': to change the background to default color.Press 'k': to change the background color to a gradient.Press 'o': to generate a flower.Press 'p': to return to normal.Press '[': to increase the transparency of the background (same effect as 'o' or 'p' but can be controlled).Press ']': to decrease the transparency of the background (same effect as 'o' or 'p' but can be controlled).Press 'q', 'w': to randomize the color.Press 'a': to decrease the size of the cursor to conceal (or potentially reveal) shapes. Press 'd': to increase the size of the cursor to conceal (or potentially reveal) shapes.Press 'z': to display hidden shapes under the cursor faintly.Press 'x': to display shapes outside the cursor's radius faintly.Press 'c': to hide shapes outside the cursor radius.Press 's': to saveMouse click: to create something cool.----------------------------------",

Biography of Ume,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/biography-of-ume,working,"During the winter months, when I do not see any flowers in the city, it is as if I have forgotten that flowers exist. Sometimes, some time after the flowers have disappeared from the world, I suddenly spot a red bud on a branch poking out from the eaves of a house. It is a time when I have become accustomed to winter and have grown too accustomed to it. I am red! I think. Red! That is the ”ume"" blossom. Many people think of cherry blossoms when they think of spring flowers, but my favorite spring flower is the ume blossom. It is a wonderful flower that reminds me that there are flowers in the world and that spring is coming.　Ume blossoms are forgotten by the time the cherry blossoms bloom. I was born into this world on April 5, right on the border of when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom or not. I am born every year with the news that the cherry blossoms are in full bloom. But the plum blossoms are history. They are history and predecessors who built the world before I was born. When I am born again toward spring, I want to cherish the past. With this in mind, I created this work, wondering if I could paint the ume blossoms.　When I was making this, I felt like I was making sweets. It was a new sensation for me. The sensation of taking something that is commonplace in everyday life and cooking it in my own way was exactly like making sweets. I don't think sweets are noble. But I think they are something a little special. Above all, when sweets are placed in front of you, they bring forth a calm joy that cannot be contained from the bottom of one's heart. If there were many colors of such joy, if there were various kinds of sweets, I am sure we would be happy. This is a ume sweet. Please try it. I believe that these will become our cells and our past.ume = 梅　This time, I put words to the color palette and shapes. It is not a universal language, but it is a special sound for me. If you want to know the meaning of the words, please ask me on twitter : @shirasu_nejio. However, I don't think that meaning is necessarily essential.",

When you mint this token you get what you see - WYSIWYG! - What you see is what you get! - this is done by overriding the hash injected into the code and locking p5's randomness and noise seed manually as parameters.Therefore, before you start tweaking these values, put the sliders at some random position for the noise and randomness seeds.To reiterate:  - The first two parameters are in place to override the hash that fxhash injects into the code!  - This is to ensure that the token you ultimately mint is exactly the same as the token you composed for yourself by tweaking the parameters.  - I recommend setting them to something random at the beginning, and then have fun changing the parameters.  - Duplicates are technically possible if you set the random and noise seed to the same value as another person. But I don't see a good reason why you would want to do that. If you really want two mints that look exactly the same, that is also possible and I also don't see a reason why you shouldn't be able to do this.+ - - - - - +The Parameters:  1. Stroke Orientation: there's three different types of stroke orientation, which essentially determine how the lines in the artwork are slanted:      - RIGHT: Horizontal and vertical strokes.      - ANGLED: slanted forward and backward strokes.      - MIXED: A combination of the two previous modes.  2. Stroke Noise Frequency: the mechanism that decides if a stroke is slanted in a vertical or horizontal (alternatively slanted forward or backward), is based on an underlying perlin noise value. The higher the frequency of this noise, the more turbulently the strokes will alternate direction. Lower values produce smoother structures.  3. Recursion Noise Frequency: Similarly to the previous parameter, a different noise value determines if the will be a recursive step creating a shorter and denser breakup of the lines. A higher frequency means that these breaks are more turbulent and more frequent and vice versa 4. Density: Simply a parameter that controls the distance between the lines. 5. Color Combo: Determines the colors applied to the artwork. There's three different options here. 5. Invert Colors: A toogle that allows the inversion of the color scheme. Background color becomes stroke color and vice versa. 6. Stroke Wobble: The higher this value the more swung the resulting lines are. 7. Scribble Amount: determines the scribbliness of the lines. The higher this parameter is the more scribbly the lines are. 8. Discontinuity Threshold: Controls the amount of discontinuity in the lines. A higher value means that there will be more gaps between the lines.",

Tranquil Orbits,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/tranquil-orbits,working,"Tranquil Orbits: A Journey Through Calming Vortices, Ethereal Motion, and Meditations in ColorIn the vast expanse of darkness, there lies a singular point of gravity, the anchor orb, a celestial body gently cradling smaller orbs in its embrace. The Tranquil Orbits project emerged from a fascination with the subtle dance of these heavenly bodies, bound together by invisible forces, their motions guided by the gentle hand of nature.The journey of discovery for Tranquil Orbits began as an exploration of the organic nature of celestial movement. An observation of the night sky, with its infinite depth, stirred within a desire to capture the essence of this cosmic ballet. The art project took shape as a series of generative artworks, each a solitary color set against the black canvas of the void.In this serene landscape, the anchor orb serves as a steadfast guide, providing a sense of stability in the midst of constant change. As the smaller orbs revolve around their celestial guardian, they appear to whisper secrets of the universe, sharing tales of worlds unseen and mysteries untold.The Tranquil Orbits project is a quiet testament to the beauty of discovery, an invitation to wander through the cosmic expanse, and an ode to the ever-changing dance of celestial bodies. It is not a grandiose proclamation of artistic prowess, but rather a humble exploration of the intimate connection between the observer and the cosmos, where the lines between creation and observation blur and intertwine.In the end, Tranquil Orbits is not solely about the final product, but rather the process of discovery, the joy of creation, and the subtle dance between order and chaos. It is an invitation to lose oneself in the infinite possibilities of the cosmos and to find solace in the tranquility of the celestial dance._____________________________________________The entire project is developed using Vanilla JS. It features a black canvas and a palette of 24 distinct colors, with one color assigned to each artwork. The artworks exhibit diversity in several aspects, such as the quantity and radii of orbs, the landscape, variations in orb textures, and some rare occurrences like eclipses.Each artwork is animated using a recursive algorithm, where the large orb gently rotates at its center while the smaller orb(s) revolve around it at varying speeds. Users can control the rotational speed of the smaller orbs and alter their rotation direction. Although each artwork has a predefined position for all orbs, users can pause the animation and save the image in any preferred state._____________________________________________To interact with the artwork:-	Increase the rotational speed of the smaller orb(s) by pressing 'u'-	Decrease the rotational speed of the smaller orb(s) by pressing 'd' or to change the direction of rotation. -	The animation responds to changes in rotational speed, but it may take a few seconds for the effects to become visible. Please wait for the effect to become visible after you press 'u' or 'd'. -	Pause the animation by pressing 'f'-	Start the animation again by pressing 'b'-	Capture a 2000 x 2000 image by pressing 'p' (this can be done during both paused and active animation). This will always generate an image with orbs in their current position.-	Save an SVG file by pressing 's'.

Littlecube Villagers (Sunrise),https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/littlecube-villagers-(sunrise),working,"Littlecube Villagers is a character voxel-art project that is built using signed distance functions and real-time raytracing.The miniature scene will be shown first and will automatically upsize in 60 seconds to prevent significant lag under legacy GPU conditions and provide a smoother user experience. This automation can be disabled as well.The time-of-day has been fixed at sunrise.The scene will randomly assign either a male or female character, each with a different body size. At times, the male character would be wearing a scarf, while the female character would be wearing a cloth hat. The pet animal can be either a Spitz puppy or a Siamese kitten, with either an open or closed mouth. The project is built using a multi-pass raytracing solution that allows subsequent iterations to have expanded scenes. There are no polygons in the scene geometry, and the voxel-art scene can be fully assembled in the form of SDF box primitives. The grid lines are derived from SDF 3D-line segments. A vintage post-processing filter has also been added.Controls:Press 'R' to immediately upsize to the main scene or switch back to the miniature scene. It is recommended to switch to full-screen mode before upsizing the scene.Press 'D' to disable automatic upsizing.Press '1' to set the camera to look at the front of the family, and press '2' to set the camera to look at the back of the family.Press and hold the 'Alt' key and use the right mouse-button to rotate the camera orientation around the scene.Press and hold the 'Z' key and use the left mouse-button to zoom the camera in and out.Press and hold the Spacebar and use the left mouse-button to pan the camera position.Press 'S' once to save a screenshot to the disk. Wait for the raytracing to converge before saving a screenshot.Other information:The application requires a GPU capable of WebGL2 and has been tested on the Chrome, Brave, and Edge desktop browsers.It also requires a powerful modern GPU for real-time raytracing. However, the amount of raytracing done has been throttled to allow users with legacy GPUs to run the application with interactive frame rates in the miniature scene mode. On legacy GPUs, it may take up to 15 minutes for the raytracing to converge.Frameworks used: three.jsRaytracing primitives template from Reinder.Raytracing line segment 3D template from bloxard.Vintage filtering template from Loadus.Copyright(c) 2022 Edwin Zeng, @doogyhatts on TwitterLicense under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0",

This time, I used the following description:- Place N points randomly on the canvas, and assign a random direction to each point. - At each step, draw the shortest line that connects all the points, and move each point along its defined directionAs usual, each step is typically drawn with very low opacity, and is repeated hundreds of thousands of times. Eventually, the interaction between overlapping lines creates unexpected patterns and textures.The recent introduction of the new fxparams system was a great opportunity to expose the inner workings of the algorithm and let collectors actively contribute to the final outputs. In my previous long form projects, parameters ranges were carefully limited to make sure all outputs were consistent. Here, exploration of extreme ranges is voluntarily left open, allowing collectors to come up with their own variations.With this system, the collector becomes a critical part of the art creation process. In order to acknowledge that, 75% of the royalties will go to the minter.To go with the spirit of this token, the total number of editions will also be an emergent property of the market: starting with a large supply of 10.000 editions, half the supply will be burned every Tuesday at noon EST, and the mint price will be increased by 1 tz.This token uses the regl.js library.

Square peg in a round hole,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/square-peg-in-a-round-hole,working,"- ""Square Peg in a Round Hole"": A Metaphor for Adaptation and Difference -The expression ""square peg in a round hole"" is a metaphor for the experience of attempting to blend in or modify one's behavior to fit into a circumstance that is not a good fit for one's unique skills, traits, or qualities. It alludes to the difficult or impossible task of trying to fit a square object into a hole that is round. This idiom is particularly applicable in circumstances where individuals must adapt to and get past obstacles in order to succeed.In today's world of rapid change, it is especially important for people to be able to adapt. It's crucial to have the flexibility to adjust and react to new situations as we come across new environments, people, and circumstances. Not everyone, though, finds adaptation simple. Some people might find it difficult to fit in or establish themselves in a new environment, which can cause feelings of isolation, frustration, or even failure. In these circumstances, the metaphor of a ""square peg in a round hole"" can be especially useful in describing the difficulties of adjusting to a new environment.The idea of ""square peg in a round hole"" is also fundamentally based on the concept of difference. We frequently experience discomfort or disorientation when we come across something that is different from what we are accustomed to. The fact that the new situation contradicts our preconceived notions and expectations may be the cause of this discomfort. The metaphor of the ""square peg in a round hole"" effectively conveys this sense of difference because it draws attention to the discordance between two objects that ought to go together but don't.But it's crucial to keep in mind that difference can also inspire invention and creativity. We have the chance to learn and develop when we come across something that is different from what we are accustomed to. We can widen our horizons, acquire new skills, and broaden our perspectives by adapting to new situations and contexts. The idiom ""square peg in a round hole"" serves as a helpful reminder that, although adaptation can be challenging, it can also present an opportunity for growth and development.------------------Press s to savePress f to skip growth and development------------------",

pico_punk_generator_generator.p8,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/pico_punk_generator_generator.p8,working,"Welcome to the ultimate pico_punk generator! This interactive token is a parameter based generator that creates unique pico_punk generators. Each one will generate one pico_punk with a number of layers chosen by you during the parameter selection phase. Additionally, you can use the buttons to navigate the generative space, and create your own pico_punks via an interactive process of discovery. This is the final pico_punk generator I intend to make, with the extra capabilities added by the parameter selection process, and the final tweaks and changes I made to the appearances and effects, I think this project is now as complete as I can ever make it.The controls:- arrow keys: move through the generative space... each step adds one layer to the composition- x button: take a screenshot of the generated pico_punk- o button: clear all layers except the current one (clean slate for building a new pico_punk)Each layer has a chance to apply one of various visual effects, which vary in how transformative (or disruptive) they are.pico_punks began as a project to create something akin to DOS Punks, but fully generative, without any manual intervention or pre-rendered components, using only the Pico-8 Fantasy Console. You can find the first generator here: (https://objkt.com/asset/hicetnunc/439049). In this early version, the generator was interactive, but each pico_punk was totally isolated, being generated from one unique seed and one consistent process. Over time, this evolved to this final experience: one in which the ""curator"", the user exploring the generator, is not just choosing from an infinite number of punks, but actually the process of exploration itself is modifying the output before your eyes.pico_punks is all about exploring themes of irreversibility, noise, pattern recognition, pareidolia, and of course identity. What began for me as something bordering on satire, has become an integral part of how I represent myself online. It is my sincere wish that with these tools you are also able to create something unique that you feel represents you, and is something that couldn't have been made without you.Thank you so much for these last couple years of support, and here's to many more making and collecting art together :)Notes on minting: - 30% of royalties go to the minter- 10% of royalties go to previous curated pico_punk holders- One reserve spot is generated for each curated pico_punk held, and they stack- One extra reserve spot is for my Mom",

The base concept of this edition is ""The Pitch Drop"": the longest experiment in historyThe experiment demonstrates the viscosity of a liquid that looks solid, the pitch, which viscosity is 230 billion times that of water. It started 96 years ago and is still running. In all that time only 9 drops have fallen and nobody has been able to see the drop fallingIt made me think about how the molecules of a liquid behave as humans, connected to each other by soft forces but clearly separated, and how in the macro and in the micro when you look close enough you can see that where there was one truly there were manyThe experiment show the importance we give to measure things and how time can give us information about what we are looking at. The continuous flux segmented in seconds and days. The constant advance vs the subjective perception. How long does a blink last?Every iteration shows a black and white composition of floating spheres or formless blobs as an undetermined amount of matter.

The artwork and experience draw inspiration from the “The Pitch Drop Experiment,” the world's longest-running laboratory experiment.

It is part of Stiles’ ongoing REPETAE series, which explores the resonances between poetic repetition and algorithmic recursion — how, in poetry as in generative art, meaning accrues through reiteration, and emotion is unlocked through the development and interruption of pattern. A conceptually and literally interactive text, SOUND GROWS INTO SPACE uses the self-replicating page provided by fx(hash) to invite close contemplation of how language is shaped and received via intimate, visceral aesthetics such as voice, visuals and melody/beat, and regenerated with every encounter.Poetry endures across space and the passage of time precisely because of a paradox: it is immutable yet intensely personal, becoming something irrefutably unique with each and every reader. In this poem, shifting parameters influence the flow of feeling and understanding, imbuing verse with multidimensional meaning and empowering deep engagement in the act of reading.____SOUND GROWS INTO SPACEBy Sasha Stiles & TechnelegySound grows into spacelike a breath taken by storm.Heartbeatin the brainwas my first taste of the word.Language flips in my chestlike a flyin a jar.The song learns to climball the airin the world.Time is musicto my earsfilling the emptiness with its own rhythms.There is no such thing as silence,only the echo of time’s longing.____For more info: https://hereandnow.events/To participate in the event: https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/here-and-now:-edition-5",

It does not mean it is not happening. Many things take time and energy to happen and to be understood.

These are the moments that I cherish, that I find meaning from, even if no one will remember them. After all, it is small drops that turn rock into sand.

Since 1927, only nine drops of pitch have fallen, and it has never been witnessed live.____While we wait for the 10th drop of pitch to fall in the famous Pitch Drop experiment, I couldn’t avoid thinking about time and change, capturing and preserving a moment of time, the history of art and science, and how we participate in the manipulation of the time itself.  The history of new media art is deeply linked to technical developments in photography and its creative applications. With still and moving images, artists were introduced to a new way of visualizing time. Through the use of time lapses, long exposures, slowing down, and fast forwarding, time was manipulated, captured, rearranged, and modified in numerous ways. The French philosopher Henri Bergson believed that reality was in flux and that ""the essence of time is that it goes by."" His thoughts about time and metaphysics had a significant impact on artists working in all media at the turn of the 20th century. Although he believed in pure perception unaided by machines, and looked down on the introduction of technology into the arts, for artists, who had always been fascinated with the body in space and time, he became their muse. Even before the widespread adoption of technological advances in artistic practices, painters were incorporating aspects of ""movement of time"" into their works (e.g., futurists, Giacomo Balla, but also Marcel Duchamp ). Another influential figure for artists was Eadweard Muybridge. In 1878 he photographed a racehorse at full speed, becoming the first to capture what looked like the actual, discrete sequence of motion. After devising the system of several cameras (12 for the first sequence he made), set in a row and arranged to go off in a sequence (with shutters released by pulled strings), he became fascinated with “secrets of time, secrets locked inside basic human movements – a leap, a splash, a walk […]”*. All of this inspired me to create and capture algorithmically generated shapes, and record their subtle changes through time and space in the style of vintage scientific illustrations, film strips, long-exposure photos, and comic book panels. Each frame inside this view is one fraction of a second later than the previous one, and the whole frame view is slightly shifted. Your actions inside of the Passage will influence everything, from the number of rows and columns inside of the grid to the color palettes, shapes, and sizes of the objects._____* Jad Abumrad (host) & Rebecca Solnet (author) say this when they talk about Muybridge in the episode Time, on the Radiolab podcast, aired Aug 24, 2010 (https://radiolab.org/episodes/91584-time)",

YYYSEED,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/yyyseed,working,"🔥 BURN NOTICE: This is a FIVE DAY ""open edition"" to celebrate the launch of fx(params). The project is open for minting from the start of Monday until midnight Friday (GMT).YYYSEED is an artwork with an aesthetic that works across digital, print and pen plotting mediums, leaning towards the minimalistic nature of drawing machines. SVGs can be exported for this purpose.I've designed the algorithm to work best for this with the default settings, you should be good to go right out of the box. You can explore the design space a little further using the parameters (more details below).If you're planning on plotting the work at larger sizes (A2, A1), then the ""Override suggest lines"" is there for you to cram more of them into the extra space.PARAMS ::::::::::::::The initial settings of the parameters are what I think best for the look I'm trying to achieve as the artist: minimal pen plotting work. This comes from the ""Suggested"" and ""Random for hash"" values.You can take the design away from that by turning the ""Use suggested lines"" and ""Use suggested destroyer"" options off, and using your own values with the slider.""Random for hash"" means the feature has been randomly selected and fixed for the current hash and won't change. For example, if the hash is 'ooABCD' and the grid's ""Random for hash"" picks 3x4, then it will always be 3x4 for that hash, it isn't random each time you change sometime. Picking a new hash however will then randomly pick a new (fixed) option.DANGER SEED :::::::::USE OF THE DANGER SEED IS NOT RECOMMENDED. If you set the DANGER SEED, the value will be encoded along with the rest of the params (where it can be decoded) in the stored data of the mint, along with the token.The DANGER SEED will only take effect if it starts with 'YYY', it will STOMP all over the other settings, including the hash.INSTRUCTIONS ::::::::h - Toggle highres mode on/off (starts off)t - Toggle paper background on/offs - Save png (in highres if toggled on)1-6 - Save SVGs for plotting A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6PEN PLOTTING ::::::::Press 1-6 to select which A1-6 size paper you want to plot onto, the the system will download one or more files for you to use, one file per colour.Please tag #plottertwitter, or #penplotter on twitter, instagram & mastodonPRINTING ::::::::::::The output of the high resolution version is 6,144 x 8,192 pixels. That will print at the following sizes.300dpi: 20.48 x 27.31 inches (52.02 x 69.35 cm)200dpi: 30.72 x 40.96 inches (78.03 x 104.03 cm)300dpi is recommended, but 200dpi should be fine for this design.

It is a comtemplation of the passing of time, the inevitability of change, and the beauty that can be found in impermanence. It is an invitation to reflect on the fluidity of life and our own place within the grander scheme of things. A testament to the resilience and grit required to survive in a constantly changing world. Despite the harsh conditions and ever-present threat of change, the desert sands endure, shifting but not breaking; their beauty and strength undiminished.Made of several overlapping curved lines, each piece is a depiction of movement and fluidity, symbolizing sands in a constant state of motion. The curves blend and mix, creating new patterns and hues where they overlap, much like the way that life experiences blend and mix to create new and unique outcomes. The uneven distribution of grains across each piece represents timelessness. Areas of low accumulation of grains are a reminder of the years of constant erosion. The sands of time have existed and will exist in a state of constant motion and change for eons, for the lifetime. This way, each piece also evokes nostalgia, as we ponder on our past lives.“It’s your reaction to adversity, not adversity itself that determines how your life’s story will develop.” ― Dieter F.

serendipity vs consequence,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/serendipity-vs-consequence,working,"This work is the result of a deterministic algorithm which manifests differently depending on the device it is viewed upon.  The basis for the project is a phenomenon called z-fighting, a common issue in 3d graphics that appears when two or more objects overlap in 3d space. The graphic drivers on a device cannot determine which  object is closer or farther from the viewpoint since they were in exactly the same place. If we consider reality to be a continuum including our physical and digital experiences, z-fighting is a strictly digital phenomenon as objects trying to occupy the same physical space usually have tragic or intimate consequences.The work in the current generative art movement is based on deterministic algorithms. This means that given a set of input parameters, the result should be exactly the same. This ideal is hardly ever the case as the code behind the art goes through different processing steps, on different CPUs, rendered on different GPUs, and interpreted by different graphics drivers. The code in this project is deterministic, it includes no conditions to adapt one way or the other to any particular hardware device, yet due to how the varying hardware and software devices try to mitigate z-fighting, this same code generates an entirely different experience on different devices.To further exploit the nuances of these consequences, this work generates an audio score based on the generated graphics, analysing the canvas with a clustering algorithm and converting color values to notes, volume, and distortion.A back-end system has been developed to render out each iteration across a variety of devices.

ABSTRACTS VOL.02,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/abstracts-vol.02,working,"This generative artwork features an array of brush strokes on a textured paper background, creating an abstract and visually appealing piece. The artwork is created using a combination of randomness and pre-defined elements, resulting in a unique composition each time the algorithm runs.Key features of the artwork and their calculations:Paper Background: The paper background is created using a semi-transparent color from a pre-defined set of five colors, randomly selected for each iteration. This background also includes a noise overlay to simulate texture, with random grayscale values for each pixel.Color Palettes: The artwork utilizes pre-defined color palettes, each with its unique set of colors and an accent color. A palette is randomly chosen for each iteration.Accent Presence: The artwork may or may not feature an accent color from the chosen palette, depending on a random roll. There's a 20% chance that the accent color will be used in the composition.Brush Strokes: The artwork is composed of a varying number of brush strokes, determined by a custom probability distribution function that favors lower numbers. The number of strokes can range from 250 to 500, with higher numbers being rarer.Stroke Generation: The brush strokes are generated in multiple passes. The number of passes varies randomly between 3 and 7. The strokes are evenly distributed among the passes, with each pass using a random color from the chosen palette. If an accent color is present, it will be used in the final pass.Brush Stroke Properties: Each brush stroke has randomized properties, including size (width of individual lines), length, angle (in radians), number of parallel strokes, and spacing between parallel strokes. These randomizations contribute to the abstract and dynamic appearance of the artwork.Canvas and Margins: The final artwork is displayed on a square canvas, with the generated composition centered and surrounded by margins.

Auroria,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/auroria,working,"Piet Mondrian's abstract paintings and Jackson Pollock's art are widely recognized as opposite ends of the modern art visual spectrum.We all know that Piet Mondrian (1872-1944) and Jackson Pollock (1912-1956) had very different and opposing lives.Mondrian's genius is found in the combination of patterned elements, resulting in a profound aesthetic that triumphantly emerges from absolute simplicity. Pollock's paintings are chaotically fractal and complex, whereas Mondrian's are simple, clean, and straight lines.Although Mondrian has always supported Pollock, their perspectives on abstract art are diametrically opposed.Unlike Mondrian, who spent weeks organizing his works, Pollock painted his canvases on the floor quickly and spontaneously.Despite significant differences in the creative process and method of execution, both artists saw their ultimate goal as reaching a level beyond life, which is only possible through the direct and profound aesthetic expression of nature.The art world viewed both abstract forms at their peak with skepticism, unable to find a link between those works and the world he dealt with on a daily basis.  Both forms of abstract art are considered modern masterpieces fifty years later.Pollock's work demonstrates that the visual complexity of his paintings is founded on fractal patterns, which can be found in a wide range of natural objects.Furthermore, visual perception experiments conducted in collaboration with psychologists have revealed that fractal patterns have an aesthetic quality. For the last fifty years, his work's precise concept of color rotation has been debated in art.Although Pollack always avoided commenting on his works, he mentioned somewhere that: My interest goes back to the rhythm of nature.The visual complexity of fractal patterns necessitates the use of descriptive perspectives that are fundamentally at odds with traditional Euclidean geometry.The fractal dimension is an important parameter in this category because it numerically represents the ascending fractal relationship between patterns observed in different unfolding trends.Pollock's style can be described as fractal expressionism rather than computer-generated, emotionless art. Pollock drew complex patterns in nature 25 years before the scientific discovery of fractals and demonstrated the ability to directly create and manipulate fractal patterns.In the ""Auroria"" collection, I presented a two-way view of modern art in opposition to classical art, using dark points, crossed lines, and fractal shapes that I drew in monochrome in the background in the works of artists such as Kandinsky, Miro, and Pollock, and I used them in the foreground in the works of artists such as Mondrian, Gerrit Rietveld in the Neo-plasticism movement.In the background, I've discussed another aspect of this point of view, Mondrian, and so on, using geometrical forms and pre-determined and conventional graphic structures and compositions.The point here is that foreground colors and lines take their identity from the background, fade into it, and colors sometimes find identity by passing through background spots, and their nature is determined by the same spots.This means that throughout the history of art, all of these theories and deconstructions have evolved into modern art by following different art schools before them and developing a distinct identity, and they are now regarded as the sparks and examples of modern art. The birth certificate of art is a chain that connects each node.And this is an undeniable ratio that places the history of modern art behind the type of view and opinion that is either in favor of or against classical art.  ""Auroria"" implies a focus on the beauty and complexity of light and color. The name is inspired by the natural light displays in the sky known as auroras, which are often associated with mystery and wonder.

"Algorithm, be my guide",https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/algorithm-be-my-guide,working,"At length, I summoned the courage to approach.-I was worn. Months of aimless wandering have culminated in this series; a meditation on my struggles to find a direction in my life and with my art.At times paralyzed by too many possibilities, and at other times completely void of ideas. I was lost in the depths of my thinking, overwhelmed by indecision and doubt.Generative works are a form of process art, yet along the way I’d forgotten to “trust the process”. It was time to cede control and let each line of code light the way.-This project paints on a 2D canvas, pixel by pixel. I used a custom projection that blends isometric and perspective techniques, to create an uncanny viewpoint between the two. Objects are randomly generated, then an algorithm applies color mixing and position displacement to each pixel as it’s rendered.By default the canvas has 2k pixels on its longest edge. You can change this in live view by pressing any number from 1-9. For example, pressing ‘4’ would render it with 4k pixels along the longest edge.

This new project boasts an improved computational process, and more importantly, a groundbreaking innovation: it generates not only with a zeta-real value of 0.5 but with various other values as well.""Yo, check it out! I've got an awesome idea to share: the closer the real part gets to the critical line (1/2), the rarer the image becomes. Isn't that boombastic?!""Regarding ""B.R. & Hendrik - Mysterious Zeta Function"",I have the same comments as I did for my previous project, ""Riemann Zeta Function (Project #24965)"".The following points apply to both projects:'Is the Graph of the Riemann Zeta Function considered art, similar to the works of famous artists like Picasso?''Whether or not the graph of the Riemann Zeta Function is considered art is subjective and open to interpretation. Some individuals might find the patterns and shapes displayed in the graph to be aesthetically pleasing and view it as a form of art, while others may not. Ultimately, the definition of art is a matter of personal interpretation and can vary from person to person. While the graph of the Riemann Zeta Function may have some artistic elements, it is not directly comparable to the works of artists such as Picasso, as the Riemann Zeta Function is a mathematical concept and not a traditional form of art.'I'm currently studying the Riemann Hypothesis. My idea was to start by plotting the zeta function Z(1/2 + xi). I searched for an HTML example on Google but to no avail. 'So I have to expand my knowledge', I thought to myself. I need to better understand calculations with imaginary or complex values and find a way to plot the graph from all the formulas.Wolfram-alpha provided me with relatively accurate Zeta values that I used as a reference to know if I was on the right track. There was also a lot of material for visual representation (i.e. drawn Zeta graphs) and many formulas. It was quite a challenge! But in the end, I got what I wanted: the Zeta graph.I was then ready to extend the function so that it can be used for the entire real positive range.Note !!!: I think my Zeta method is technically correct. However, the result can be so inaccurate that one would have to declare the results as incorrect (e.g. for real parts <0.2 / clearly visible).I assume that this is an error that only has to do with the truncation of decimal values (including rounding errors).But still, I do not know if my Zeta method is correct!Especially if you use these html procedures forserious mathematical work, be extremely careful!Otherwise, I would simply like to offer you what I was originally looking for: ""A ready-to-use solution to plot the Riemann Zeta graph.""

Non-objective Cliché,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/non-objective-cliche,working,"After years of exploring the possibilities of algorithmic art, I have come to believe that I should enjoy the process and be guided by the exploratory nature of creative coding. This whole project began with a happy accident - my innocent desire to recreate by code a piece of art whose layers my friend Flexasaurus had forgotten to save.We both have been pursuing the creation of simple shapes and compositions that could evoke a range of thoughts, associations and emotions in the viewer. Our inspiration is rooted in non-objective art, Suprematism, and Brutalism architecture, focusing on the use of basic geometric shapes, bold colors, and digital textures to create visual interest and depth.We certainly know that geometric, non-objective art is probably the most overused concept in creative coding, and yet our ""non-objective Cliché"" was too entertaining and too provocative. I was intrigued, and Flexa loved to curate and inspire me along the way, so I could not work on anything else until it felt finished.While working on this long form project, I grew to want each output unique enough that it could not be confused with any of the other iterations. This led me to explore a variety of compositions and algorithmic ways to create them. In the process, I discovered even more of the unique possibilities offered by the algorithms, and the result came out beautiful.Something was missing, however. Kazimir Malevich's ""Black Square"" or any of Rothko's color field compositions would not evoke the same feelings without their unique physical texture. I could try to recreate a physical texture, but that was not my way.I wanted to find a purely digital, code native way to achieve texture that moves you.I started with something as simple as a dashed line.- - - -then a dashed rectangle- - - -- - - -- - - -- - - -and a dashed disk, and a triangle. Such a purely digital concept is in the nature of the code - the sequence of ZERO's and ONE's.0101010101 - It is a ONE or a ZERO. A signal or its absence. Something or nothing. I loved it! I guess it loved me too, because the coding gods allowed me to dig and dig and dig and dig, adding different shaped 'strokes', different intervals, random endings, circular strokes, Perlin noise matched fields of strokes, noise or pattern filled strokes - I myself do not know all the possibilities for all the different digital textures, because they are too much.Strokes and their successors filled the shapes and the compositions, giving them the power to inspire thoughts, associations and emotions even better.One of the things I find most exciting about this work is the way it invites interpretation. Although the shapes are abstract, they suggest something different to each viewer. Some may see a cityscape, others a landscape, others a microcosm of cells or molecules, space or a situation or emotion. The eye is drawn into the forms and follows the interplay of color, shape and texture.At its core, this work is about the power of algorithmic art to create something beautiful and thought-provoking from simple building blocks. It's a testament to the endless possibilities of generative art, and I am excited to share it with the world.So here it is.

Wind on mind,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/wind-on-mind,working,"The use of lines and waves in art is a fundamental element that has been utilized by artists throughout history. Lines and waves can be used to create a sense of movement, to add depth and dimension to a piece, and to draw attention to specific areas of an artwork.Lines can be straight or curved and can vary in thickness and length. They can be used to define edges, create texture, or to lead the viewer's eye through the artwork. In art, lines can be used to create a sense of movement, for example, by creating diagonal lines that give the impression of motion or by using converging lines to create the illusion of depth.Waves, on the other hand, can create a sense of fluidity and movement. They can be used to create an organic feel to an artwork or to represent the movement of water or wind. Waves can be created with lines that curve and overlap, giving the impression of an undulating surface.In some artworks, lines and waves can be combined to create a dynamic interplay between the two elements. For example, a painting of a seascape may use lines to represent the shore or horizon, while waves are used to represent the movement of the water. The combination of the two elements creates a sense of movement and depth, drawing the viewer into the artwork and creating a sense of immersion.The use of lines and waves is not limited to traditional art forms such as painting or drawing. Lines and waves can also be utilized in digital art, such as in graphic design or animation. In digital art, lines and waves can be used to create dynamic and engaging designs that capture the viewer's attention and convey a sense of movement and energy.In conclusion, lines and waves are essential elements in art that can be used to create a sense of movement, depth, and dimension. Whether they are used in traditional art forms or digital media, lines and waves can be combined in unique and creative ways to create dynamic and engaging artworks that capture the viewer's attention and imagination.",

We have been looking for a safe place to stay for months, and with several relocations, depression set in, and it was difficult to believe what was happening. I thought that such events only happened in movies and history textbooks. The only way to distract myself was by coding. And then, during one of our relocations, I realized what should be the main idea of this project. This is what I had watched for hours during every relocation. Whether it was a bus ride or a train ride, only the background changed, but the landscape was almost the same - endless Ukrainian wheat fields.

One of its most fascinating features are the numerous constellations that direct our gaze to the night sky and stimulate our imagination. These constellations are more than just beautiful arrangements of luminous points in the sky; they symbolize our relationship with the universe and the forces that shape it.The constellations we see in the night sky are the result of billions of years of cosmic evolution. They tell us the story of the universe, from the formation of the first stars to the formation of galaxies and comets. These constellations remind us that we are part of a larger cosmic story and that our fate is tied to the fate of the universe.When we look closely at the constellations, we realize that they are constantly changing and evolving. New stars are born, old stars pass away, and galaxies move through space. This constant change reminds us that the universe is not a static entity, but a dynamic and constantly evolving system.The uniqueness of the universe is evident not only in its size and complexity, but also in its ability to give rise to and support life. The night sky shows us not only the beauty of the universe, but also the wonders hidden within it. We are not only observers of the universe, but also part of it, and it is our responsibility to protect and preserve it.The universe is infinite, but its infinity is not just a mathematical fact. It is a source of inspiration that encourages us to rise above our limited human experiences and explore the mysteries of the universe. We will never know everything about the universe, but we can always venture further into this infinite expanse and expand our knowledge and imagination.Overall, the universe is a fascinating and beautiful entity that never fails to captivate us.

When you look through the viewer of the kaleidoscope, these images multiply into complex and fascinating patterns.The reflections in the kaleidoscope are created by the mirrors inside the cylinder. Typically, there are three or four mirrors, which are placed at specific angles to create the reflected patterns. When light enters the tube, it is reflected by the mirrors, creating a symmetrical image of the object or glass fragment placed at the end of the cylinder.The result is a series of reflected images that repeat in geometric patterns, creating a mesmerizing visual effect. Each time you rotate the kaleidoscope, the images transform into new and surprising combinations of colors and shapes.In summary, a kaleidoscope is a tool that creates fascinating and colorful reflective images. The reflections are created by the mirrors inside the cylinder and multiply into complex and symmetrical patterns. It's a great way to explore the properties of light and color while creating visually appealing and mesmerizing images.In this project, I drew inspiration from the mesmerizing reflections and variations that a kaleidoscope can create, as well as its simple yet elegant design.

Paths That Join,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/paths-that-join,working,"Connections, paths, flow. Paths That Join is about representing these ideas in a simple and poignant way. There is an invisible grid. Points are selected at random, serving as anchors, joints to a whole. Like the five pointed star that you could draw with a stroke of a pen without lifting the nib, the selected points are connected and their order is also random. An arc or a straight path connect any two points. The paths they make pulsate, spreading color into the surrounding pixels. Their arrangements criss-cross or, in other iterations, evoke glyphs and abstract park plans. Their directions are both circular and angular. They are paths that join.

Nocturne,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/nocturne-1,working,"Nocturne captures a mystical moment in time, where the city is sleeping under the light of the moon. The work depicts a cityscape at night, with the warm glow of streetlights and windows reflecting on the calm waters below. The moon casts a silvery light across the scene, imbuing the city with a magical quality that is both captivating and enchanting.In the foreground of the work, a delicate paper boat floats on the sea, a symbol of innocence and childlike wonder. Its fragile presence in the vast expanse of the sea highlights the endless possibilities of exploration and the hope that accompanies the embarking of a new journey. Even the smallest vessel can set out on a journey of discovery.Nocturne is a work that encourages us to slow down, breathe, and take in the beauty of the world around us. Invites us to immerse ourselves in a world of wonder and imagination that captures the beauty of the night and the magic of the city, at the darkest of times, where there is always a glimmer of light and hope to be found.Nocturne's color palette is limited to blues, purples, browns, and greens, evoking the moody and atmospheric quality of the night.Moon Phase: Fool Moon, Waxing Crescent MoonBuildings: Apartment buildings with TV antennas, Gable roofs with chimneysStreet Lights: Globe, Modern100% code.Press [s] to save a PNG file with a minimum resolution of 4000px.",

Life in The Waste Land,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/life-in-the-waste-land,working,"In 1970, mathematician John Conway devised his eponymous ""Game of Life"", also known simply as ""Life"", a cellular automaton that plays out on a 2D grid of orthogonal cells. The game requires a starting configuration of ""living"" cells (all other cells are assumed to be ""dead""), and at each discrete step forward in time, the following transformations occur:- Every living cell with fewer than two living neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.- Every living cell with more than three living neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.- Every living cell with exactly two or three living neighbors survives.- Every dead cell with exactly three living neighbors comes to life, as if by reproduction.- Every dead cell without exactly three living neighbors remains dead.Conway's Game of Life feels very simple at its outset. And yet, computer scientists have discovered a staggering degree of complexity, and a vast lexicon of dynamic forms, all within the bounds of its highly constrained 2D universe. It is Turing complete, meaning that given a large enough grid and an appropriate starting configuration, it's possible to create a functional computer inside Game of Life. Given unlimited processing power and memory, one could run Game of Life inside Game of Life inside Game of Life inside Game of Life... ad infinitum.But what would it look like for a small percentage of living cells on the grid, in the course of their ""lives"", to write some poetry?What if each living cell also could increment somehow at each time step it stayed alive, imbuing cells with a visible age?""Life in The Waste Land"" is Conway's Game of Life applied to poetry -- more specifically, a poem: The Waste Land by T.S. Eliot.In this implementation of Game of Life, the grid is monospaced text, and each living cell has a very small chance of generating a few lines, all entirely inspired by The Waste Land. Each token will track its unique starting configuration's progress forever. The grid is infinite, and the dynamic patterns extend far beyond the fixed boundaries of your screen. Some tokens will remain dynamic for a very long time, while others will settle down quickly, at which point continuously living cells may iterate through nearly every Unicode character.Thank you for collecting.

EQUAL,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/equal-1,working,"Artists have long utilized various shapes to create a multitude of effects and express their ideas. Two shapes that have been used extensively throughout art history are rectangles. In this essay, we will explore how the use of rectangles in art can evoke feelings of stability and balance while still allowing for creative expression.Rectangles are one of the most basic geometric shapes and are often associated with stability and order. They can be used to create a sense of structure and organization within a piece of art. For example, an artist could create an artwork in which rectangles are arranged in a grid-like pattern, giving the piece a sense of balance and symmetry. Alternatively, artists can use rectangles to convey a sense of movement and fluidity. This can be accomplished by manipulating the size and position of the rectangles. For example, an artist could create an artwork in which rectangles are arranged in a way that creates the illusion of motion. By varying the size and direction of the rectangles, the artist can create a sense of dynamic movement, even within a static piece.Another way in which rectangles can be used to create art is by using negative space. Negative space is the area surrounding the subject of the artwork. By utilizing negative space, an artist can create a sense of depth and balance within the piece. For example, an artist could create an artwork in which a rectangle is placed in the center of the canvas, surrounded by negative space. This type of artwork can create a sense of balance and stability, while still allowing for creativity and expression.In conclusion, rectangles are a versatile shape that can be used in a variety of ways to create art. They can be used to create a sense of structure and organization, as well as movement and fluidity. By using negative space, an artist can create a sense of balance and depth within the artwork. Whether used individually or in combination with other shapes, rectangles offer endless possibilities for artistic expression.",
Hide one's light under a bushel,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/hide-one's-light-under-a-bushel,working,"The idiomatic expression ""Hide one's light under a bushel"" is a phrase that is often used to describe people who are hesitant to share their talents, skills, or abilities with others. This expression is derived from a biblical parable in which Jesus encourages his followers to share their light with the world instead of hiding it. The book of Matthew, chapter 5, verse 15, says, ""Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick.""Throughout history, many individuals have been reluctant to reveal their skills and abilities to the world. Often, they feel that their efforts may be inadequate or that they will face rejection or judgment. As a result, these individuals decide to keep their talents to themselves and forego the opportunities and rewards that come with self-expression. However, by doing so, they miss out on the chance to share their unique gifts with others and make a positive impact on the world.On the other hand, some individuals have the confidence to let their light shine. These people have faith in their skills and are eager to showcase them to the world. They use self-expression to build strong connections with others, spark change, and improve the world because they understand how effective it can be. Sometimes, the bush may be able to hide the sun, but in this case, the light can shine through.In general, the proverb ""Hide one's light under a bushel"" exhorts people to have faith in their own abilities and identities. It serves as a reminder that self-expression is a potent means of forming relationships with people and changing the world. While it may be tempting to keep our skills a secret, we should work to let our light shine since we have the power to motivate others and change the world.It is also important to recognize that self-expression is not just about showcasing our strengths but also about acknowledging our weaknesses and vulnerabilities. By being honest about our limitations and struggles, we can build trust and empathy with others, which can in turn inspire collaboration and growth.In conclusion, the idiom ""Hide one's light under a bushel"" encourages us to have faith in ourselves and our abilities and to be open and authentic in our self-expression. By doing so, we can connect with others, create positive change, and live a fulfilling and meaningful life.----------------Press s to save----------------",

In this sense, NFTs are often treated more like stocks than art.The floor price, as always, will be in the hands of the market.

Collatz Bezier Rainbow,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/collatz-bezier-rainbow,working,"These are Bezier vertices using numbers from sequences made from the Collatz conjecture https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjectureThe color of each vertex is defined in the HSL range relative to how large is the sequence compared to the size of the largest sequence found so far in the generation. Because it uses fxrandom() for each new number, the colors should slightly differ during each generation.The number of generated Bezier vertices is limited between 2 and 60, because a single vertex can leave the whole screen blank, and more than 60 can't be seen in the canvas space. In fact, the whole Bezier curves can't be seen in the canvas space, but this is deliberate and carefully coded for the artistic impression of the specific part that can be seen.A lot of Collatz sequences were pre calculated using a Python script for the higher Features, but for low number of vertices they are calculated at run time.The controls are optimized for a QWERTY keyboard:q w e ra s dz x cYou can see what has changed in the Javascript console log.r: Restart the drawing (it is best to wait until the last drawing has finished, because the code is asynchronous)The random number multiplier is a factor that affects the size of the integers to search for the Collatz conjecture. The initial value is 60 - the number of Bezier vertices. For 50 Bezier vertices it means the random numbers will be multiplied by 10 at the power of each iteration (1e1, 1e2, 1e3, ... 1e50). The higher the multiplier, the higher is the probability of a larger sequence, and the drawing overall will be more green / blue. Shorter sequences will make the drawing appear more red.The numbers until 21000 have the sequence pre calculated in the collatz.js file, but numbers larger than that will be calculated at run time.q: Decrease the random number size in powers of tene: Increase the random number size in powers of tenw: Resets the longest sequence size to zeroThe number of Bezier vertices define how crowded the canvas will be. Since the vertices are overlapping others, the highest value of 60 will fill all the screen, making a pattern as if matrix printers are drawing with colored crayons during an earthquake. The lowest value of 2 will show two random recognizable Bezier patterns with different colors.a: Decrease the number of Bezier curves or verticesd: Increase the number of Bezier curves or verticess: Save the current canvas to PNG formatThe animation delay is the number in milliseconds that the async function will timeout until the next vertex is drawn.EPILETIC TRIGGER WARNING: If there are too few curves and the delay is too fast, you can be affected by the quick changes of the colors.

All these are echoes from childhood - watercolor lines of a child not bothered by a special artistic idea but trying at least to a fraction of mastering the fine arts and cubes reminiscent of ones which children use to build towers.Overall, the piece is a tribute to the joy and creativity of childhood, and to the power of artistic inspiration that can be passed down from one generation to the next.Made with p5js and a few GLSL shaders.",

- Satellites -,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/satellites-1,working,"-Satellites-The Space Probe project was humanity's bold endeavor to explore the universe beyond our own solar system. At the height of the space race between the years 2400 and 2500, hundreds of probe satellites were sent out into the unknown, each with a unique mission to collect data on distant galactic objects and search for signs of life and habitable planets.As the probes ventured to the edge of the solar system and beyond, they extended humanity's reach and understanding of the universe. Many of these probes were equipped with the ability to communicate their findings back to Earth, allowing us to delve deeper into the mysteries of the cosmos.The probes took many forms, including galactic probes, communication satellites, and planetary probes designed for sample return. As they floated in the vast wasteland that surrounds the Milky Way galaxy, these probes searched for organic molecules, the building blocks of life, and conducted their missions with determination.Although some of the probes have since become redundant, they continue to float through the void, reminders of humanity's unending quest for knowledge and discovery in the universe. The Space Probe project was a landmark achievement, pushing the boundaries of human understanding and paving the way for further exploration of the cosmos.X to toggle the Animation (on/off)R to resetBuild with WebGLGert-Jan Akerboom - 2023(20% of primary sales will go to girlswhocode.com)",

These experiences pile up to form the foundation for everything to come, shaping our perspectives and influencing our sense of self, character, and worldview.'Pile' embraces the infinite possibilities of generative art to represent the rich, complex, and cumulative nature of life's experiences through the passage of time. Each moment builds on top of previous memories, where the present is always the sharpest, yet is soon obscured by what follows. Just as the imprint of past experiences can linger in our lives, the influences of older layers can still be seen in each piece, imbuing each composition with a depth and variety that is indicative of life's many histories. Composed of these textured and stacked layers, ‘Pile’ forms a dense and organic heap that embodies the controlled chaos of life's multitudes.Responses to our experiences tend to oscillate between thoughtfully pragmatic and mechanical means – and more sensitive, organic, and even passionate approaches. They’re a blur of exactitude and wildness, entropy and growth, a range of experiences and outcomes that vary so greatly that only by changing our perspectives and taking a step back can we see the commonality between each of our piles of life’s moments. The result is a visual representation of the cumulative nature of life's experiences, where forgotten moments and cherished memories are piled high with abandon, yet worthy of celebration.Inspired by the works of artists such as Jackson Pollock and Joan Mitchell, 'Pile' invites us to contemplate the rich and multifaceted nature of life, and to celebrate the distinctive stories that each of us carries within. Through its vivid abstraction of life's controlled chaos, and the tension between organic lines and overtly digital marks, 'pile' beckons us to consider the intricacies of our own layered identities and to revel in the diversity of life.created in p5.js._________________________Controls (in live view):- Press ‘p’ to save png- Press ‘1’ - ‘9’ to run a high resolution file (higher resolution files will take longer to load)",

Lorda,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/lorda,working,"------------Introduction------------Argentina is world-renowned for its exquisite wine, and the Malbec grape has long been a celebrated variety. While most of the country’s wine comes from the region of Cuyo, specifically the province of Mendoza, there is another hidden gem that is often overlooked: Entre Rios.Named after the two massive rivers that surround it, Entre Rios is a province located in the northeast of Argentina. What many people don’t know is that it boasts a long and fascinating history of wine production that dates back to the early 19th century.During a recent visit to Entre Rios, I had the pleasure of exploring a small vineyard located near the Parana river. As I walked among the vines, I couldn’t help but feel inspired by their vibrant colors, intricate patterns of the leaves, and the beautiful clusters of grapes. It was clear to me that there was something truly special about the vineyards of Entre Rios.As I delved deeper into the region’s history, I discovered that until 1937, Entre Rios was one of the largest wine producers in the country, with over 60 vineyards operating in the province. However, a national law was passed that year creating the Regulating Board of Wine, which concentrated and granted exclusivity to wine production in Cuyo. It wasn’t until 1993 that the law was repealed, allowing vineyards to be planted and modified throughout the country.Today, Entre Rios is home to a small but thriving wine industry that is known for its unique blends and varietals. One of the most notable grapes is the Tannat, which was once the predominant variety in the region.Inspired by the beauty of these vineyards, I decided to create a generative art collection that celebrates the colors, shapes, and textures of the grapes and vines called ‘Lorda’.-----------About Lorda-----------Tannat originates in southwest France (Madiran). However, it was not very admired there, so Tannat began its journey: it moved to our country, in the trunks of a Basque, Juan Jauregui, and settled in Entre Rios towards the end of the 1800s. This farmer nicknamed “El Lorda” planted Tannat in Concordia and managed to make a quite respectable wine. The grape took that nickname and became known as Lorda.-----Press ""e"" to save a high res png while in live mode.-----Artwork by @cristianrohr (2023)Made with P5js and <3",

The '1' key toggles between disorder and order. The '2' and '3' keys allow you to toggle displacements.The '4' key enables you to switch between entropy or not.The '5' key lets you switch between mixed textures or assigned textures. You can reduce, amplify, or flip the displacement using the 'u' or 'j' key. To remove a color press 'c'. To reset to all colors, press 'v'.You can save a PNG file using 's', a JPG using 'd', a PNG with twice your window height using 'f', and a print size image using 'g'.This work explores composition based on generative double grid system, where rotations, displacements and noisy lines intertwine to form a playful loom.Created with p5.js rendering in WEBGL.",

Playtime,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/playtime,working,"This project, like most of my work, is about order and disorder.The grid, the archetype of order, is used to arrange a set of rectangles. These rectangles are then extruded to become blocks/boxes. Here the perspective is created by means of a formula of projection of points on an isometric plane. Depth of field only exists because a sequence of instructions erases the background as the composition is built.Order is also present in the succession of each of these steps.And disorder? It is very subtle, insidious, but nevertheless it exists in certain details within these blocks. These are details that do not follow the general shape of the box, residual, forgotten parts of blocks that have been erased.----NOTE ON THE TITLEThe title Playtime refers to the film (1967) by Jacques Tati, the cubes generated here evoke the settings of the film (the exteriors of this modern city and certain interior settings such as the open spaces). The analogy is made in the perception of these spaces, thanks to the use of the depth of field of the glass and the reflections.A link is also made through the film's few dialogues. The characters do not really understand each other, they speak several languages (French, English, German and some are not subtitled). The misunderstanding arose during the writing of this programme in the form of a bug, an error in the way of erasing certain parts of the composition in the background. Once the error was corrected, the composition offered little interest because the volumes described were perfectly solid, eliminating any perception of depth. This misunderstanding of the way my programme works gave place to a singular perception of space and depth.----FEATURES & OPTIONSGrid size: indicates the number of rows the iso grid will contain (between 14 and 22)Zoom:  the magnification factor of the composition (between 0.7 and 1.74).Block height: between 0.15 and 0.50, determines the general height of the blocks and the vertical position of the grid  Height variation: how the height of each block is decided, three chances out of five, to have a totally random arrangement otherwise the height decreases from left to right or from right to left.Iso angle: between 1.85 and 2.1, the smaller this parameter is, the more the grid is seen in bird's eye view (projection = [x-y, (x+y) / {angle}]).Crop mode: This parameter depends on the zoom feature, from a certain threshold (>1.11), the blocks will be cut cleanly according to the margins (hard), otherwise they will simply be deleted (soft) if they go out of the frame (in whole or in part).Palette: The three colours used respectively for the background, the texture (not included in the SVG) and the lines. 90% chance of getting a black line on a white background.Format: portrait (A3) or square, 50% chance of getting one or the other.Options & exports available in live mode (fxhash.xyz) or at IPFS artifact url (objkt.com) by clicking on the canvas, a window will open allowing you to export the drawing (PNG and SVG) as well as different formats.----RESOURCE & LICENSEDeveloped in Typescript (with 2D Canvas) with the Greiner-Hormann polygon clipping package (NPM: greiner-hormann), Playtime is a plottable NFT, it is part of the Hybrid Series (for more information click on the canvas on live mode).This project is licensed under the MIT license.----Nicolas Lebrun / @nclslbrn / nicolas-lebrun.fr",

Mercalli,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/mercalli,working,"""Earthquakes don't kill people, buildings do."" – UnknownEarthquakes are not just natural disasters, but also human tragedies. They can strike suddenly and violently, leaving behind a trail of destruction and trauma that can last a lifetime. For survivors, the experience of an earthquake can be life changing.Homes and neighborhoods are reduced to rubble, and the familiar landmarks and memories of a lifetime are wiped away in an instant. In the aftermath of an earthquake, survivors must grapple with the emotional toll of their loss, the uncertainty of the future, and the challenge of rebuilding their lives.The first step after a disaster is to provide emergency medical care, shelter, and basic necessities like food and water. Once these immediate needs are met, attention can turn to assessing the damage and developing a plan for reconstruction.The rebuilding process can be a long and challenging journey, as it involves not only repairing physical damage but also restoring the social fabric of affected communities, addressing issues like housing, infrastructure, and economic recovery, as well as addressing the psychological and emotional impact of the disaster on individuals and communities.It is crucial to rebuild using proper techniques and investing in the right resources to prevent similar disasters from happening in the future. Reconstruction must be done with a focus on resilience, sustainability, and safety. This means taking into consideration the local conditions, the latest research on earthquake-resistant materials and designs, and the needs of the affected communities.The cost of not investing in proper reconstruction after an earthquake can be immense. Poorly constructed buildings and infrastructure can increase the risk of further damage in the event of another earthquake, leading to more loss of life and property. On the other hand, investing in proper reconstruction can help create a safer and more resilient environment, reducing the impact of future earthquakes and protecting the lives and livelihoods of those who call the affected region home.For this reason, it is crucial that regions impacted by earthquakes receive immediate and adequate economic and technical support, and that available resources are managed with proper planning and great responsibility.This generative art project explores the destructive power of earthquakes and seeks to capture the raw emotions of those who have experienced earthquakes and the transformation of their world into a memory.100% of the primary split is going to @tezquakeaid, Tezos community initiative providing aid to the victims of the catastrophic earthquake that struck Turkey and Syria on February 6, 2023.

Itten,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/itten,working,"Homage to Johannes Itten a Swiss expressionist painter, designer, teacher, writer, and theorist associated with the Bauhaus. A pioneer of color theory and major influence of Op artists and other expressionist painters in his day.Itten's idea of the color wheel is embodied in the HSL color model where a hue can be located on a circle (red at the 0-degree mark, green at the 120-degree mark, blue at the 240-degree mark and back around to red at 360 degrees or 0). So a hue is a number between 0 and 360), saturation (a number between 0 and 100), and lightness (a number between 0 and 100). In this work a color space is defined by four random HSL colors placed at the corners of the picture frame. Then, given any point in the picture plane, a unique color can be calculated using a bilinear interpolation scheme. This way a unique hue can be determined relative to the corners of the space frame, relative to a set of four random colors. For a little variety I vary saturation for each iteration of an image between 75 and 100. I set lightness at a constant value of 50.The tiles are formed by using another idea from the Bauhaus that I call fractions of the whole. I divide the X and Y axes into several non-uniform increments based on a number of random integers and project their spacing into the picture frame to create a tessellation of uniquely shaped tiles. A color calculation is made for each tile is based on the center of the tile in the color space and filled with that color.Experience images of pure color based on a couple of Bauhaus ideas.

More than a predetermined story, the project is a kind of a contemplation and a question about the crucial role of language, story and imagination in our relationship to the natural world around us and the technology that we develop and engage with.Kristen Applegatehttps://kristenapplegate.crevado.com/ As an artist, I am inspired by the intersection of technology and traditional craftsmanship. My work often uses humor to make playful yet thought-provoking statements about the consumption of animals, insects, and even humans as food. Recently this exploration has taken the form of creating AI images that become actual or projected surface decoration for pieces of ceramic dinnerware. Prompt-crafting with AI interfaces such as Midjourney and DALL-E allows me to create the odd animal-like storybook characters as well as the imaginative renderings of meat that appear in my work. My “anti-tale” characters are depicted in a vintage style that adds an element of nostalgia.For our Floor project, Iofeye and I are delving further into the notion of storytelling using the extra anti-tale characters who did not make the cast list for my ceramic work. In this project, they get to tell their own stories in their own languages. I'm excited to hear what they say.Indira Iofeyehttps://linktr.ee/iofeyeMy art is characterised by experimentation, exploration and intuitive expression and I am drawn to the potential that lies in collisions and connections between different media, expressive formats and conceptual universes. I am fascinated by the hybrid creations, by unlikely collisions and combinations, unpredictable turns and “mistakes”. For me, art and the artistic process are not solely about expressing something that already exists or is known, but also a way to ask and address questions about multiple aspects of existence, self, world and our relationships to different phenomena. It is also about opening up to a discovery and the encounter with the unknown inside oneself and the world through the creative process.Some of the themes that I have worked with and that occupy me are storytelling by different means, the role of myth and the phenomenon of language, its role in our self-imaginary and our relationship to it.The combination, the intersection and the synthesis of different themes, concepts and modalities of work that Kristen and I have brought into the project has given rise to a really engaging and interesting collaborative process and generated new fascinating avenues of possible explorations and discovery.--This token is part of The Floor Exhibit co-curated by the NFT Museum of Newberry, SC and Fort Gallery NFT.",

Hills of Chaos,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/hills-of-chaos,working,"Hills of ChaosThe beauty of chaos is the concept that out of disorder, randomness, and unpredictability, can emerge patterns, complexity, and surprising beauty. Chaos theory suggests that small, seemingly insignificant changes in a complex system can lead to dramatic and unpredictable outcomes.In art, the beauty of chaos can be seen in many forms, including abstract expressionism, action painting, and generative art. In abstract expressionism and action painting, artists use techniques that rely on chance, spontaneity, and improvisation to create works that are characterized by an energy and vitality that comes from the unpredictability of the process. These works often have a raw and visceral quality that can be very powerful.Generative art is another form of art that often celebrates the beauty of chaos. Generative art is created by using algorithms and programming to generate art that is unpredictable and evolving. The artist sets up a system, but the final outcome is determined by the interaction between the system and the viewer. This creates an artwork that is constantly changing and surprising, with the potential for emergent patterns and unexpected beauty.In nature, chaos can also be beautiful. Examples include the patterns of clouds, the fractal branching of trees, or the intricate and seemingly chaotic patterns of the ocean waves. These natural systems are often too complex to fully understand, yet they exhibit a beauty that is undeniable.In summary, the beauty of chaos lies in its ability to create unexpected and surprising outcomes, whether in art or in nature. The unpredictability and randomness can create patterns and complexity that can be breathtaking and inspiring.In 'Hills of Chaos' are two possible sizes, square and rectangular aspect ratios 5000x5000 and 7500x5000, 20 color palettes, some of them taken from ""Studio Yorktown Color Town Hall"" by @StudioYorktown (studioyorktown.github.io/coloryorktownhall)To download high-resolution 'PNG' file, open 'LIVE' and press 'S'February 2023Made with p5JS library",

I consider this not an artwork, but rather a postcard which other fellows from the Cohort 2 could mint and save as a memory about WAC Fellowship.----------------ConceptSnake game is almost as old as a computer display. A player should try to make a snake as long as possible. Waccy snake is gathering some Web3 related tags (knowledge) and becomes a web3 literate. Waccy is smart and s/he always chooses a better option when there are multiple of them for the next step. But at some random point there is no more way and you will see a total blocks gathered and also a cloud of unpicked tags. A tag which Waccy picked the most times will be highlighted with white (consider this as your prediction or smth ;).Also I think that snake is some kind of a blockchain itself, when each new block is built on the previous chain. Enjoy!-------------Technical detailsBuilt using p5.js and polar.p5.js. Radial pattern at the background is generated randomly of some lines, triangles, hexagons and octagons. The matrix is always 10x10. Snake randomly starts at any cell close to the center of the board. Snake always chooses the next step which is potentially better than the others (if it could go top or left, but from left there is only one step further and from top cell there are 3 ways - snake will go top).

Different mediums such as pastels, chalk, and colored pencils are used to create varying strokes of color to achieve different effects. The purity of graphics can be achieved by the use of these mediums, which have the potential to create intense and vivid colors. However, the stroke also has a significant role in the depth of meaning in art. Artists like Degas and Petrov-Vodkin, for example, utilized stroke techniques to create emotional intensity and atmosphere in their artwork. Degas' use of soft pastels to create ethereal strokes in his Impressionist paintings, and Petrov-Vodkin's technique of creating strong contrasts with dark and light strokes in his Symbolist paintings are perfect examples of the power of stroke in art."";Shift is a series of 128 unique pieces;Resolution is 2560x1440 / p5js;Tom Bluster;",

Carnival Dream,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/carnival-dream,working,"INCEPTIONCarnival Dream is a project that I started more than a year ago, when I was getting back to playing around with code as a creative outlet.I was learning how to implement a simple grid and tiles system but at that moment didn't think much of it. As it often happens, some time passed and I was drawn back to the simplicity of those forms and wanted to give it a spin: I added more color options and the possibility to have more than one palette in a single picture. I posted the results as my ""Tessellation"" entry for Genuary 2023, and felt I just couldn't stop there. I added different tile sizes and color patterns, explored the variability in the generated outputs and eventually set to what I think gives the most interesting results.IDEAS & VISIONThis project tries to delve into the complexity of a multi-sized and multi-colored square grid.The different sizes of the tiles reflect the interaction between the macroscopic and microscopic scale of things in our life: we need to always pay attention to both the big and small details to fully appreciate anything and anyone in its entirety.I chose to use bright colors that give a strong contraposition to the simplicity of the three types of tiles: the Circle, the Three Lines and the Half Triangle.The different dimensions of the grid allow for the exploration of multiple structures and interactions between colors and shapes, always resulting in unexpected balanced or blissful lack of stability.FEATURES EXPLANATIONGrid size: the number of units into which the grid's sides are dividedPalette colors: an assortment of 1 to 6 colors from the available 6 palette pairs (darker and lighter tones).Reverse color: a flag to set whether to invert the darker with the lighter color in the palettes.Color pattern: ""random"" choice of destiny, ""lines"" or ""circles"" as a way to harness the unpredictable.Tile sizes: available sizes for the tiles.THANKSMy special thanks to @AlfredoBoaron who has pushed me into finally publishing my work and bounced ideas back and forth with me.Many thanks to @gorillasu for his incredible useful blog https://gorillasun.de/And thank you to everyone who chooses to collect my art!",

And what if the vision directly sprouts from the hands instead of the mind”, the artist asks.“Is the vision thrown through the shadow of the hands, or is the shadow hands the vision itself?”, the magician responds.As an attempt to add a line to this whimsical dialogue, I dropped shadows to cast visions. To my great surprise, the artist and the magician blent into each other…- - -“Ombromanie” refers to the art of creating images made by hand shadows. The word and the art (also called “shadowgraphy”) was popularized by french magician Félicien Trewey in the XIXth century. Sure the shadow art is not so popular nowadays, but it still shares with generative art part of the same mystery and magic. The code projects shapes and colors on a screen to create images; the hands project a shadow on a curtain to create figures.“Ombromanie” was conceived as a curtain where articulated hands (or better, shadow of hands) throw a firework of shapes, creating a wide range of random compositions. I heard the magician words and I did implement five features for this magical trick:- the curtain can be entire or hemmed,- the image oriented the right way up or upside-down,- one or two hands can be used for the invocation,- the phatasmagoria reveals itself as syzygy or chaos,- and climax is reached through twelve ways.Hands are always present, but in extremely rare cases they could vanish behind the curtain…   - - - This project uses twelve custom color palettes – the climaxes.Ten are inspired after works or body of works by well known generative artists.

This part is a modified and extended code I used to create a set of six pieces titled “Sketches for unreliable structure” (Objkt, December 2022).

During this time I daydreamed about a nostalgic era when everything was chill and relaxed: no worries about war, bad economics, mortgage or career race, just putting on a bossa-nova vinyl to play, sipping a glass of rosé, enjoy the summer breeze while sitting next to a pool on your patio during the sunset hours.

The resulting drawn image is dense, visually striking, and sensitive to initial conditions, representing the chaotic and unpredictable nature of the system.The complex and unpredictable nature of these images inspires feelings of awe and wonder as we attempt to comprehend the intricate patterns created by the pendulums. The image's dense and complex nature captures the observer's attention in an effort to understand the mathematical and physical principles behind the movement of the pendulums. At the same time, the repetitive and rhythmic movement of the pendulums in a seemingly effortless manner creates a calm and serene landscape.During the creation of the image we only see twenty of the one thousand double pendulums.

seekers,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/seekers,working,"Seekers is inspired by the view that is held by mathematical realism, that mathematical entities objectively exist independently of the human mind. Therefore, mathematical entities are not constructed by humans, but rather, are discovered by humans.

The mathematical space is being explored and discovered by a group of seekers, which hover and fly around within the layers of infinitely evolving shapes. The vicinity of a seeker also modifies the surrounding mathematical space, which means that the seekers will never reach the objective reality.The generating functions are created using human-curated evolutionary algorithm following the idea demonstrated already in Karl Sims' paper 'Artificial Evolution for Computer Graphics' in 1991.———Features 29 generative base functions, 15 palettes in various modes.

Platonics,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/platonics,working,"A response to being buffeted by forces outside of our control. Platonics sought to find order, control and solace in the Platonic solids. Instead it found beauty and intrigue in the emergent chaos that can arise from even the simplest systems.Its building blocks are the five Platonic solids. Forms which have fascinated humanity for thousands of years. Their title comes from the philosophy of Plato, who equated each of the solids with a classical element.Platonics arranges these forms in a series of geometric layouts, with varying density and randomness. At one extreme we see tidy radial circles consisting of a single solid. At the other, packed pentagons consisting of jumbled solids give rise to Escher-esque compositions which hold near infinite variety, variety enhanced by a range of pens and colours that draw and fill those solids.This relationship between order and disorder is at the heart of Platonics. The collection seeks to show how they are not so far removed from one another – and how we might embrace them both. It also aims to give collectors a behind the scenes look at how generative compositions can be constructed.The geometric proof that there are only five convex regular polyhedra (the Platonic solids) states that at each vertex of the solid the angles between adjacent sides must be less than 360 degrees. This amount less than 360 degrees is known as the defect angle.It is from this geometric proof that the collection size and pricing for Platonics is derived. There will be 360 Platonics sold via a Dutch auction priced according to the defect angles of the five Platonic solids: 180 > 120 > 90 > 60 > 36.https://www.phaust.art/platonics----------Competition: Submit your favourite previews via Twitter to win a free mint and print.Prints: Free gallery-grade, signed A3 prints for the first 18 mints.Live: Press ‘S’ to save in hi-res or append '&size=#' to the URL for custom height.Info: Original artwork by Phaust.

The Streamline,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/the-streamline,working,"Form, an essential aspect in architectural design, refers to the shape, structure and arrangement of spaces or objects. Witnessing how forms work in a space can also be a transcendental experience, where one can sense the presence of a form, not only seeing it.As there are many ways to create it, Form can appear as an internal structure, as an external shape of a two dimensional plane that envelopes a three dimensional mass, or a repetition of a two dimensional shape that stacks on an axis and moves to a certain direction. With so many ways to create shape, there is no law dictating that shape has to be rigid. And this is where Milunic and Gehry's design for the Dancing House comes in as an inspiration for this work.A change in the political axis from one of a regime to a parliamentary democracy was what influenced the architects to juxtapose two different energies together. With its dynamic and static shapes in tandem, Dancing House is one iconic proof that form can also be pliable and animated.------------Press [s] to save captured image------------It may take a few seconds to render, depending on the device.works better with chromecreated using WEBGL on p5.jsdirbots - Feb23",

AERO,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/aero-1,working,"AEROIn the stillness of the void, floating cities hang suspended, bound by no earthly gravity. The buildings, wrought in shades of dreamy pastels, appear as though they have been plucked from some other time and place, and set adrift in a new and unknowable realm.Here, amidst the stillness and silence, ropes hang loosely like vines, connecting the structures in a delicate web of possibility. The architecture of the buildings is vaguely familiar, yet strangely surreal, hinting at a past now forgotten.As the eye wanders through this landscape of suspended structures, a feeling of nostalgia begins to seep in. There is a sense that these cities were once inhabited, bustling with the energy of human life. Now, they stand alone, abandoned and forgotten, as nature slowly reclaims its territory.The AERO series explores how a minimalistic set of shapes and rules can be extrapolated to create complex assemblies, the same way individual buildings will form villages and cities.To add a sense of organic texture to these geometric structures, ropes that connect certain squares have been added. They can sometimes take on the appearance of vines.

Fabula,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/fabula,working,"Fabula (lat.) is a chronologically sequential representation of events and adventures in a work of art; canvas, a scheme of development of life events, presented in a sequential order.As in ""Secrets"" and ""Melancholia"", in this work I continue to explore the psychological diversity of people and their feelings, using colors and abstract shapes.Just a few of my actions from the past define the overall picture of my life. These are important events in a certain sequence, my achievements and mistakes, which most significantly affected where I am now. There are only a few of them, but their influence on my present and my future is enormous. I would like to change some of my actions, but it is already too late - the decisions have been made, the roads to my future have been paved, the plot of my story has been formed, the picture of my life has been drawn. The only thing left for me is to believe that I will still be able to add a few good touches to the canvas. In this work, the placement of figures on the canvas demonstrates the influence of one or another of my actions on my entire life, and the colors indicate its psychological evaluation. Probably, the same can be said about every person. Each of us creates our own fabula and paints our own picture, the colors and shapes of which sometimes make up a very harmonious overall image, regardless of what meaning it carries, positive or negative. And this strange harmony can become a separate topic for an interesting discussion, because it can be the key to proper self-awareness and self-perception.Technically, we have a simple Voronoi algorithm with my own metric. No predefined shapes like lines, curves or circles are used here. 3-14 points (X,Y-coordinates, in the console) are randomly fixed on the canvas => these are the vertices of the diagram, around which, according to the metric, unique Voronoi cells are sequentially formed pixel by pixel, each of which has its own shape and color. The number of important human actions corresponds to the number of colors and vertices of the Voronoi diagram. Also, note that the borders of the cells are specially blurred (clearly visible if you zoom in), because each of the colors (actions) can potentially displace part of the others, increasing its impact on the overall picture.

Vagafilium,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/vagafilium,working,"Imagine thousands of travelers wandering from place to place and leaving a thread everywhere they stop to rest. Some traverse the world, others their own city.  This generative art piece uses this simple concept to generate colorful patterns on different scales and with different palettes. The name Vagafilium is from the Latin for ‘wandering thread’.There are ten possible palettes, some more likely to be chosen than others. Each is sampled from a photo taken over the past month and adjusted to match the energy of the work. The live version shows the threads of different sizes being drawn on the canvas.Royalties are split with the minter.Special features:Press 1, 2, or 3 to export a PNG at 1000 x 1000 pixels (the size of the canvas), 2000 x 2000 pixels, or 3000 x 3000 pixels respectively. Retina displays will generate PNGs with twice the resolution per side at each level. You may have to wait thirty seconds to a minute for the export to complete, so please be patient.Press ‘s’ to export an SVG version of all of the threads on the canvas. These are drawn with the stroke widths and the colors in the image version and can be edited in any vector program. I hope some of these get sent to a plotter.",

OBLIQUE,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/oblique-1,working,"“OBLIQUE” is an art piece from my ""FLUX"" series that explores the theme of destroying and constructing an image simultaneously. Through diagonal (oblique) manipulation of pixels, multiple unrelated layers are integrated to form a unique composition.The work began with an exploration of creation of curving lines with noise and eventually, a repetitive vortex-like circle shape emerged, reminiscent of Leonardo da Vinci's water flow and flood drawings or the rhythmic drawings of Sy Twombly. I used some of the patterns I discovered as the basic elements of this work. (It was a long process, but in the end I decided that the first parameters I found were superior. I also started a derivative work, “fl00d”, on the theme of flooding).In addition to these organic curves, flow fields and rect() and circle() are placed as elements.Although they are unrelated layers in terms of processing, they are integrated by diagonal (oblique) pixel operations and transformed into a different kind of shape.In this work, I was also conscious of including the process of creation itself as a variation of the work, and of leaving it as a code.With the evolution and spread of AI, it is necessary to reevaluate the value of creating without understanding and forgetting after understanding, and I felt that these processes were important elements of the works of human.The ability to reflect these elements in a work of code art is one of the interesting aspects of Generative Art with p5js.The title ""OBLIQUE"" takes inspiration from the ""The Function of the Oblique"" of architecture discussed by Paul Virilio, a theorist of the information society, and artchitect Claude Parent. （I don't know the details of that at this time, so this is just inspiration from those words.）The term “Oblique” also refers to muscle tissue. Muscle tissue can be said to be a representative example of being strengthened by damage.It is possible to get a 5760 x 3240 px png file by right click save.Please feel free to contact me if you have any inquiries.Artwork by hasaqui, @hasaqui.Made with p5jsLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0",
